Hopefully you’ve already read the post about speed tests.  For the avoidance of doubt, running one is not the answer to this question.

Here are the best things you can do, before getting in contact with our Incredible Support team.

## Check eView Live

Login to eView Live and have a look at the live data feed.  You can go back 3 hours (rolling) in detail, and are presented with the last 15 minutes up front, refreshing every 10 seconds.

If you are saturating the upload or the download (or where when you noticed the slowness), then this will be the cause of the slowdown.

By saturation, we mean maxing out the connection in one or both directions.  Link saturation means an increase in latency, and the propensity for dropped packets.

It means traffic struggles to get through (trying to squeeze too much into a small hole), and the result is things feel slower.

## Do You Have QoS?

If you do have our Quality of Service feature installed, then the above shouldn’t happen.  But if saturation does mean a lowering of performance for, say web browsing, where it’s really noticeable, then your QoS profile may need adjusting to better suit your needs.

Don’t assume that if it doesn’t work first time that it won’t work at all.  Our QoS feature is powerful, and can be tailored to fit almost any scenario.

Get in touch as soon as you have any issues with performance when you have QoS enabled.

## Get In Touch

We’ll use our advanced monitoring platform and diagnostic tools to look at the problem.

We’ll confirm what the individual lines are synced at, and whether there are regional or local issues causing any problems.

Our engineers will test the available bandwidth by running throughput tests from the bonded internet gateway on your site, through to the edge of our network.

We’ll confirm if all the lines are healthy and all responding and not flapping up and down, or varying in throughput rate.

## Think About What Everyone Is Doing

Knowledge is power, and the more you know about your network and how your users work, the better you’ll be at diagnosing problems and predicting future upgrades.

If your connection is regularly being saturated, then consider adding more bandwidth, or adding QoS or Bandwidth Amplification.

Consider managing your own network more closely to reduce misuse of the internet connection, filtering unwanted traffic, or deliberately blocking types of use or software.

The more you control on your network, the easier it is to know what is going on on your internet connection.

## What If I Just Want To Know How Much Bandwidth I Have?

For the control freaks amongst us, sometimes you want that reassurance that you do have the bandwidth when you need it, and we recognise that this is sometimes why it’s so tempting to run a speed test.

You want something that appears to be independent and reliable, to tell you everything is ok.

Well, please do resist the temptation to run a speed test.  You can read about this more here, but there are more accurate ways of testing and checking.

Be warned though, all (including speed tests) are intrusive tests, which mean they will degrade the service for other users while you run them.

The best thing to do is get us to run our own throughput tests.  These too are intrusive, but they deliberately disconnect your traffic while the tests are run (something speed tests do not and cannot do), so you might be down for a minute or so, but we can get a very accurate result of how your connection is performing.

If you want to do it yourself, then we can arrange to perform an iperf test with you – where you will run a small piece of software from the command line (you will need some IT skills), in order to test with our servers (both inside and outside our connection).

You can also try to saturate your own upload and download by performing multiple streams of both.  Download managers, like FlashGet, can help do this on the download (remember to connect to places with lots of reliable bandwidth), and multi-stream FTP programs, like SmartFTP, can help you do the same with the upload.

None are as convenient as just pressing Go on a speed test, but they will be able to test your available bandwidth more accurately, and with real world examples.  You’re more likely to actually want to download or upload a file than perform a speed test as part of your job aren’t you?

Remember again to do these things in isolation, and for the best test, bypass your firewall altogether and connect directly to the bonded internet gateway.  You’d be surprised how many problems exist on people’s networks and on their firewalls.

## Is It All About Bandwidth?

It most certainly isn’t, and the measure of how much throughput you can get might be pretty irrelevant to how you actually work.

Make sure the tests you run will actually report on what you need, and that they have a proven track record.  Again, we have test tools built into our network, so your best bet is to leave the hard work to us.  If you want to know about latency, packet loss, jitter etc, then just get in contact with or Incredible Support engineers.

Let them do the heavy lifting, and with enterprise-grade servers and software behind them.

It’s not all about bandwidth, so if someone in your office says their VoIP call isn’t working, or a remote desktop session is laggy, then running a bandwidth test will not only interrupt their call and session, but will not tell you anything you don’t already know.

If the connection isn’t saturated – check eView Live – then it’s not a bandwidth problem.

We have QoS to sort out packet issues, and priority, and we have Bandwidth Amplification to boost the available bandwidth, and help you use it more efficiently.

You can do all those things yourself in different ways, but all of them require either significant investment, or a complete change to the way users go about their internet habits.  When we turn them on, you don’t have to do anything.

Enterprising Opportunities is the latest company to take advantage of the cutting edge bonded ADSL solutions offered by Evolving Networks.

Enterprising Opportunities is a partnership of organisations with a shared vision of supporting enterprise and improving lives. The business works across an array of industries, all operating within the third sector. Enterprising Opportunities are pioneering and innovative focusing on the positive changes that they can make to peoples’ lives and to their community. 

Increasing staff numbers is always a major change for any organisation, and one that needs to be carefully planned and managed very carefully. As well as dramatically increasing staff numbers at their new Head Office in Herne Bay, Enterprising Opportunities were also looking to launch a ‘hot desk’ environment for client businesses.

In order to support both staff and clients, a heavy duty internet connection was needed to replace the existing single ADSL line. As a not-for-profit organisation, value for money was a prime factor in considering both the type of solution and supplier.

By getting in touch with the market leaders for strength bonded ADSL, Enterprising Opportunities soon found the supplier they were looking for in Evolving Networks. Evolving Networks were able to provide Enterprising Opportunities with a bonded ADSL solution that was cost effective and offered very high capacity internet connectivity.

Having delivered the bonded ADSL solution at Head Office, Enterprising Opportunities were happy to subsequently migrate single ADSL lines at two remote sites to Evolving Networks. This enabled Enterprising Opportunities to route their VPN connections through the private Evolving Networks cloud, delivering further security and performance enhancements.

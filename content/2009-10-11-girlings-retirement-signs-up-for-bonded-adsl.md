Girlings Retirement, the acknowledged leader in the provision of private retirement property, has become the latest company to benefit from the installation of a fully managed bonded ADSL solution from Evolving Networks.

With a growing portfolio of sites in the UK a high quality, reliable communications infrastructure is becoming increasingly important and the legacy single ADSL line on site was not up to the job.

With a number of staff on site needing high quality ADSL access for internet and email, as well as site to site links, the choice of replacement internet connectivity solution was an important one.  With SDSL connectivity not available, bonded ADSL was an option that would deliver both the high capacity upload and download requirements.

With a private network spanning the breadth of the UK and the industry’s most flexible bonding platform, Evolving Networks were consulted as part of the supplier selection process.  There is no “one size fit’s all” mentality with Evolving Networks, who understand that every business is different and every bonded ADSL solution is used in a unique way.

This consultative approach, coupled with ability to demonstrate real time, live examples of bonded ADSL solutions currently deployed, made the purchasing decision for Girlings straight forward.  Having chosen Evolving Networks as supplier of their managed bonded ADSL solution, the deployment process was handled smoothly and with no loss of connectivity.  Delivered on time and on budget, Girlings users have noticed an immediate improvement in speed over their single ADSL.

With the most flexible bonding platform in the industry, a private UK network and uniquely consultative approach working with customers, Evolving Networks has quickly become the leading supplier of industrial strength bonded ADSL to demanding users.  With a particular specialty in the defence industry, supplying Thales Air Defence, BAE Systems and the BVT Surface Fleet site building the new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.  Accredited and approved supplier to the Health Protection Agency as well as supplying other high profile public sector intuition such as the Imperial War Museum and HMS Belfast, Evolving Networks is relied upon for business grade ISP connections.

I would like to make an announcement.

Evolving Networks will not be making any commitment to join a broadband speed guarantee scheme proposed by the consumer group Which?.

Why? I hear you ask.  Because it’s stupid.

We’ll gloss over the term “speed” for the purposes of this – we all know where we stand on <a href="/bandwidth-is-not-speed" target="_blank">bandwidth versus speed</a> and if not, please read about it here.

Bear with me while I comment on each point, and then explain what we actually commit to do, which you’ll hopefully see is good, and indeed better.

**“We’re calling on broadband providers to give you the speed and service you pay for as we discover around three in five people experience problems with their broadband.”**

Ok, they are setting the scene here based on some research they will have done, and I do want to be clear at this point that we don’t actually deal with consumers, only businesses, but you will be right in thinking that broadband problems are also rife in the business world as well.

We absolutely believe that a customer should get what they pay for, in terms of speed and service, although we recognise that this will vary greatly <a href="/location-location-location" target="_blank">depending on a customer’s location</a>.

We are largely in the hands of BT Openreach and BT Wholesale for most ADSL circuits throughout the country.  Sync rates of these lines vary greatly depending on your location (mainly distance from your telephone exchange).

**“Our research shows that nearly half of broadband customers have suffered slow speeds, with six in ten having to put up with these sluggish speeds frequently. And there’s more – many people just aren’t getting the speeds they were promised.”**

Ok let’s not comment on the survey itself, just on the outcomes.  Sluggish speeds frequently and the concept of promised speeds.

You can’t promise speed.

It may not be ideal, but the broadband technology in this country is such that you can make an estimate of the speed, but you can’t promise it.  When a line is installed, it runs through a 10 day training period where some complex jiggery-pokery tests are done to analyse the line’s performance, setting some key metrics such as the maximum stable rate.  In general speed will be sacrificed for stability (better to have a line that stays up, that is a bit slower).

I would find it hard to believe that any ISP these days is actually promising a speed.  The industry has been through the mill in terms of backlash for promising speeds, and maybe I am just spoilt in working for an organisation that understands that and does whatever it can to counter it, but I find it hard to believe there are still ISPs saying “You’ll definitely get 8mbps”, for example.

“Sluggish speeds frequently” is about congestion – or what people know as contention.  As we’ve stated before, there is nothing inherently wrong with contention.  It’s just that the term is misunderstood and has been twisted to mean something negative.  Read more about contention and congestion <a href="/our-approach-to-congestion-and-contention" target="_blank">here</a> though if you want to know more.

This is mainly about price.  There has been a race to the bottom with the price of internet connections in the UK.  ISPs want to say how many thousand customers they have, prepared to make a teeny bit of money on each one, surviving only by having a large volume.

To keep it cheap, these ISPs buy less bandwidth than they need.  They introduce congestion into their network, and therefore when their network gets busy, everyone’s speeds start to reduce.  They may also have some kind of network level traffic management policy that slows down certain types of traffic, or deliberately restricts heavy users over lighter ones.

We don’t do either of those things.  We are more expensive than our competitors because we buy enough bandwidth for all of our users to do anything they like with their connection.

We don’t employ network level traffic shaping to throttle iPlayer or torrents or any traffic, and we don’t penalise someone for using a lot.  It’s unlimited, unthrottled, uncapped and uncontended.

Yes, that costs more, but what do you expect from your enterprise grade internet connection?

We can actually be even cleverer with each individual connection, employing the latest Quality of Service technology to prioritise traffic and reduce latency and packet loss, but this is on each customer’s connection, and based on what they need and want, not what we want.

**“…millions of us are getting frustratingly slow speeds and having to wait days to get reconnected when things go wrong.”**

There are two issues here.  One is that if there is a line fault, then we have to get BT Openreach to fix it, so applying pressure to us as the ISP can be futile.

The other is cost again.  If you are paying pennies to your ISP, then they aren’t going to have hired enough technical staff to be your advocate with BT Openreach, and to give your line fault the attention it needs to get fixed as quickly as possible.

We pride ourselves on our diagnostic abilities, and when it comes to line faults, we are like a dog with a bone.  We will also spot early indicators of line faults, and nip them in the bud.

We check every line multiple times a day for speed and performance.

We are the ones hassling BT Openreach, so you don’t have to.

**“A quarter of people who reported a loss of service and had it resolved waited two days for this, and around one in ten had no internet for a week or more.”**

This is the same argument.  The time taken to fix a fault will vary greatly depending on what it is, and will invariably be inextricably linked to BT Openreach.

We sell bonded internet connections, so uptime is improved with every additional circuit, and a great way of shortening or eliminating downtime, but still, when a line is down, we get it fixed.

**“We want broadband providers to give you written speed estimates at the start of your contract, and to let you exit that contract without penalty if they fail to meet those speeds.”**

This is about the sales function within the ISP.  What we do is talk to potential customers about the estimates for their lines, provide a written estimate, and then we qualify that estimate.

We don’t just quote the figures from the broadband availability checker, because they are pretty useless to a customer.  The sync rate of an ADSL or FTTC line is not what a customer will actually be able to use.  8mbps sync is more like 6.5-7mbps of actual throughput, and even then it depends on some other factors.

What we do is talk about realistic, often conservative estimates for what a connection will deliver.  They are estimates, because until a line goes in, we can’t possibly say for sure, but we err on the side of caution because we don’t want unhappy customers!

We’d rather someone was pleasantly surprised by a faster connection than the reverse.  We want happy customers and for them to stay with us forever.

What about failing to meet those speeds?  Well for a start, who is measuring this?

If we’re suggesting that a popular, but inaccurate, ad-sponsored speedtest website is used, then we’re already off to a shaky start.

The number of issues we come across (that we see through to their conclusion because we care about the customer experience) where a customer’s firewall being to blame for poor performance, or other users on their network are why things feel slow, is huge.

If we run detailed, reliable throughput tests on a connection and they say everything is fine, but the customer says otherwise, who is going to have the final say?

**“We also want them to fix any loss of connection as speedily as possible and to refund you if problems persist.”**

I really think that every provider will say that they are fixing things as soon as possible.  It may not mean that they are, probably because they don’t have the staff and resources to do so.

They will say they will, but you do get what you pay for, and the dramatic and continuing lowering of prices in the UK for broadband means that that service isn’t going to get better any time soon from those providers with the cheapest connections.

We have a very simple 99.9% SLA for uptime. So barring a tiny amount of unplanned downtime, we already do credit customers for outages on their connections.

**What will we actually commit to?**

  * We believe in improving the broadband network in this country.  We want customers to get greater bandwidth, greater reliability and greater customer service than with any other ISP.
  * We are continuing to develop new and innovative ways of improving user experience with services such as <a href="/so-what-do-we-mean-by-qos" target="_blank">QoS</a> and <a href="/introducing-bandwidth-amplification" target="_blank">Bandwidth Amplification</a>.
  * We commit to doing everything we can to deliver the best possible stability and bandwidth to every customer we have, and to maintaining it.
  * We commit to being honest to customers about what they can expect on their connection, rather than giving a complex series of “up to” and “between” figures which have no bearing on actual throughput.
  * We commit to upgrading customers free of charge to ADSL2+ and FTTC when they become available.
  * We commit to continuous improvement and development.

Are we the cheapest? Absolutely not.

Are we the best? We’ll never be satisfied, but be your own judge.

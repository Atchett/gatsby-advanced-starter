WIN Plc are the latest company to take advantage of the unique Evolving Networks bonded DSL offering, as the companies today announce a supply agreement that will see the innovative provider of bonded DSL solutions provide fast, reliable internet connectivity to a site currently struggling to get by with single link legacy solutions.

As a leading provider of mobile solutions WIN Plc’s data transfer needs are high, with data being both sent and received in large quantities and at all times, day and night.

In order to meet the needs of a newly purchased business, WIN Plc needs a fast, reliable, resilient and robust connection, with 10mbps download and in excess of 4mbps upload capacity.  Having conducted extensive market research, Evolving Networks were the logical solution.

The bonded DSL solution will be deployed quickly and will take advantage of both SDSL and ADSL technology, providing a business class bonded DSL solution.  Once in place the bonded DSL link will be used for both VPN and internet & email traffic.

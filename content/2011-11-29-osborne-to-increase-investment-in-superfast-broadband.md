On the day George Osborne delivers his Autumn Statement, Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) has been tipped to receive an impressive cash boost with Osborne announcing an extra £5bn of capital investment for his £30bn National Infrastructure Programme (NIP) today.

At the time of writing, BDUK has already put aside £530m until 2015 to help 90% of the British population gain access to superfast broadband with speeds of up to 24mbps. However latest figures suggest that by the end of 2015 a third of the UK will still not have superfast broadband available.

Additionally, it has been known for a long time that the BDUK’s budget could increase to £830m by 2017, with the extra £300m coming from the BBC’s TV License Fee. But already, it looks as if that figure could rise even higher. 

The money is predicted to be paid out over the next three years, with many suggesting that any new funding for broadband will be applied for in the current coalition government (i.e until 2015). 

The move looks to be welcomed by BT and Fujitsu as well as other BT rivals, as all have been recently asking for a greater allocation of money in order to help improve and enhance the national broadband infrastructure. 

With the government now investing serious money into delivering UK homes and businesses with superfast broadband, now is a great time for any business to be investing in optimising their connectivity.

We’re settling into our new offices well. Its been a couple of months now and whilst we’re still getting used to the extra space we’ve been quick to start filling it up!
  
We’re pleased to welcome four new starters. Siobhan and Josh join our Administration team, with three new Software Developer Apprentices (Mikey, Brandon and Joao) also joining the DevOps team.

Our CEO, Nick Johnson; “we’re very pleased to welcome Siobhan, Josh, Mikey, Brandon & Joao to the team. By expanding both our Admin and Software Dev Operations we’re adding a lot of capacity, which will help accelerate development of our software and improve internal administration. We’re excited to keep expanding to meet the challenges of growth.”

“Adopting a DevOps culture in our technical teams also means that even for the smallest support issues, the team has access to the most senior software developers and network engineers, who have a permanent mentoring function within the team.”

Evolving Networks provide innovative software enhanced connectivity and SD-WAN solutions to businesses throughout the UK, delivered via their Network Virtualisation software and unique, multiVNO access network.

Our commitment to the apprenticeship scheme has seen us previous winners of the UK Apprenticeship Providers of the Year Award. Joao Vittoriano says; “its exciting to join a fast paced industry and to work at a company that has such a focus on apprenticeships, there’s a lot to learn but we can’t wait to get developing!”

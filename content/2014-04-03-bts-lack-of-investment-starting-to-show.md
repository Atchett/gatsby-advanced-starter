Actually its not just a lack of investment, its also poor network management.

A lot of things tend to stem back to poor network management.  Not increasing capacity in line with user growth for example.

We are now seeing a worrying trend from BT.  It started when we accurately predicted that in local areas (local cabinets and exchanges), [FTTC would start running out of capacity.][1]

This has already started happening (although from what we can see, they are in effect protecting users of the network by not overfilling it with new users) as our own cabinet serving Datum House is still waiting for further FTTC capacity.

But there are more worrying things happening.  We’re starting to see entire BT exchanges closing for orders of ADSL2+.  Let’s be clear here, these are areas where no one can order an ADSL line while that is the case!

In the areas we have found, there is no FTTC available either.

We’re trying to get a list of exchanges and expected upgrade dates from BT at the moment, but it means we literally can’t place orders for some new and existing customers.

The rollout of 21CN is a very important project for BT, and in my opinion, has not been timed well with other investment (such as FTTC).  BT may argue that economics play a big part, and that people paying for so called superfast products like Fibre to the Cabinet, actually help pay for extended services to those in rural areas.

I don’t actually believe that for a second.  The FTTC rollout (which is now basically over) was all about making the entire project economically viable and to pay for itself.  Clearly in our local area, here, it was only economically viable to put in a certain amount of equipment and a certain amount of backhaul bandwidth.

Fair enough.

But good network management would have meant that no one would ever be delayed in receiving a new service, because as the limits are reached, new equipment and backhaul upgrades are put in place.

This hasn’t happened – poor network management.

And because the economics of the FTTC rollout appear to be so self-contained, I’m not sure how the people in the most desperate areas are being benefited at all.

We are dealing with a number of customers with 4x bonded ADSL (ADSL Max Premium, because the exchanges haven’t been upgraded to 21CN) that are suffering from poor or inconsistent throughput rates throughout the day.

These exchanges also don’t have any LLU (you can read about the economics of that [here][2]), and so there is little we are able to do to improve the situation for them.

We are or have employed our latest bonding technology including our suite of enhancements under the guise [Bandwidth Amplification][3] to try to improve the situation for them, but compressing and managing bandwidth is not a complete fix.

We commit to always buying enough bandwidth to engineer contention out of our customer connections, and we have also successfully identified faults in a number of areas where BT haven’t added enough capacity.

With these latest areas though, we are being stonewalled by BT.  We have escalated and escalated, and fought our customer’s corners, but we are being now told “it’s within the product specification”, and “1.5-7mbps is the acceptable range”.

Let’s be clear, that means that someone with 4x 8mbps sync lines can and does often get only a total of 6mbps.  That’s just not right.

They are still better off with 4 lines, as otherwise they would only get 1.5mbps, but BT have essentially abandoned these exchanges.

There are no dates to install 21CN.

So we are in a situation now, where it would appear that all the focus has been on the FTTC rollout, and the headlines are being grabbed daily with news of BDUK projects that, for all their hype, will not be the great saviour, in much the same way as FTTC has not been.

This focus on FTTC has led to a great many rural areas not getting their upgrade to much needed ADSL2+ lines, and EFM services.  Some would be happy just to get the throughput rates they have bought, like our 4x bonded customers who already have 8mbps sync lines, but the money just isn’t being put into the old 20CN network.

IPStream-based services are being run into the ground, exchanges with 21CN are being shut to new business, and [FTTC capacity is running out][4].

This is poor network management from BT, and a crucial lack of investment, which is doing nothing but continue the widely held belief that BT just aren’t in it for the whole country.

We have always prided ourselves at being able to engineer a lot of BT’s problems out of their offering by bonding lines through our private network, and adding additional services on top to improve things.

We are going to continue to innovate, and provide extra services to those customers who are experiencing issues with the BT network, so that they aren’t left behind.  [Quality of Service][5] and [Bandwidth Amplification][3] technologies such as [live data compression][6] and transparent multi-streaming are helping these problem areas, and we will keep adding technological improvements, if only because BT have stopped investing.

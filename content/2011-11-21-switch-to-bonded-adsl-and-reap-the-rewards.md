**There are so many great benefits to be gained from switching to bonded ADSL for your company’s communication needs that it can be difficult to list them all in one place, but we’ll give it a go.**

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a fast communication technology that allows much faster data transmission over copper lines than a conventional voiceband modem.

Bonded ADSL takes multiple internet connections and creates a single virtual connection. ADSL bonding is a complex operation which offers increased physical upload and download capability and is a credible alternative to leased lines. A bonded ADSL solution substantially increases the upload and downloads speeds of a connection; 8Mbps upload rates are available with an Evolving Networks bonded ADSL2+ service.

**Bonded ADSL is Fast and Reliable**

Bonded ADSL solutions have been developed to give businesses the speed and reliability of leased lines, with the cost benefit of broadband. By bonding, rather than simply load balancing, you get fast performance and an internet connection that works harder the harder you push it. ADSL has come a long way in the last five years. ADSL is a mature technology, delivering high capacity download speeds, and quick deployment cycles.

A range of different companies have chosen to subscribe to a bonded ADSL line. Organisations ranging from city councils to defence companies have chosen to transfer their digital information via a bonded ADSL package, due to the overwhelming benefits of the service.

Many subscribers have been quick to praise the reliability of their bonded ADSL connection. These lines are guaranteed with a 99.9 per cent SLA, ensuring organisations receive the speeds they have been promised. Other feedback from customers includes positive comments regarding the quick installation and flexibility of the service.

**Enjoy Effortless Streaming with Bonded ADSL**

Companies looking to switch to a bonded ADSL line can reap immediate rewards. The faster speeds that come with bonded ADSL mean that they will be able to take advantage of services such as HD IPTV, or Video Conferencing, which are not particularly feasible with lesser broadband packages currently on the market.

Bonded ADSL can deliver speeds as high as 80Mbps or more, resulting in vastly improved upload and download rates. This results in a faster service all-round for consumers, and can drastically affect how a company moves data around on a day-to-day basis.

**Bonded ADSL Set to Play a Big Part in the Future of the Internet**

Looking to the future of the internet, in view of how it has developed over the past five years, the advantages to be gained from taking out a bonded ADSL line become more and more apparent. Your business can really benefit from switching now.

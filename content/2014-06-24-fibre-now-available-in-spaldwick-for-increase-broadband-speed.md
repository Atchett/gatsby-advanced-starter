As you may know we have been working closely with Mark Heath over at [Increase Broadband Speed][1], and today we have been delighted to hear that FTTC is now available in his area of Spaldwick, Cambridgeshire.

And as part of Mark’s commitment to getting better broadband for residential and business users in Spaldwick, he has updated the [Spaldwick website][2] to let everyone know that fibre has landed!

Increase Broadband Speed have been testing bonded ADSL with Evolving Networks for a few months now and have been very happy with the performance of the connection. They have rigorously tested 2x bonded ADSL and more recently tested 3 and 4 bonded lines (you can read their reviews [here][3]).

However, with the wait for FTTC in Spaldwick finally over we can now place the order for Increase Broadband Speed which will allow them to begin their testing on bonded ADSL and FTTC with Evolving Networks.

We’re really excited for the Increase Broadband Speed team and keen to get their fibre connection live so that together, we can continue to raise the awareness of bonded internet connectivity in the UK!

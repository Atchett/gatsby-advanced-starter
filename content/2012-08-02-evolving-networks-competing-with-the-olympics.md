Last week Evolving Networks announced that we were dramatically increasing our internet bandwidth to accommodate for the increased traffic that is expected to take place during the London Olympic Games.

The arrival of fans, spectators, game officials, organisers and 20,000 media representatives was expected to lead to a massive hit on UK internet infrastructure.  With so many users likely to tweet, watch live videos and so forth during the games, it looked likely that many customers’ connections were going to be negatively affected, with slow speeds expected.

However as Evolving Networks is always ahead of the game, we radically increased the bandwidth to our private network and we’re happy to announce that we have recorded no connections affected.

With the increase to the bandwidth, accommodating for the heavy traffic caused by the Olympics, all of our customers have been receiving the high speeds that they have come to expect from Evolving Networks.

Increasing the bandwidth for all of our customers is just one of the tasks that our UK based engineers carry out to deliver incredible customer support to all of customers.

As we have talked about in previous posts, we&#8217;ve been working with Mark Heath over at Increase Broadband Speed to raise awareness of bonded connectivity in the UK.

In April, the team at Increase Broadband Speed published their <a href="http://www.increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk/review-ADSL-bonded-evolving-networks-part1" target="_blank">first review</a> which focused on their trial of bonding two ADSL lines with Evolving Networks. We were delighted with this review and flattered at the positive comments made about our service.

We are happy to say that <a href="http://www.increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk/2014/bonding-three-four-ADSL-connections" target="_blank">Part 2</a> of their review is now out! This time with a focus on bonding 3 & 4 ADSL lines. Again, we could not be more pleased with this and are so grateful to the Increase Broadband Speed team for their continued enthusiasm.

As the trial goes on, Increase Broadband Speed will be posting more reviews. Each with a different area of focus. We’ll keep you posted!

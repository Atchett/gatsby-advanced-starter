It’s official. Evolving Networks is the most dynamic SD-WAN provider in the UK.

Tech industry media platform Enterprise Management 360 has ranked Evolving Networks alongside Cisco and VMware in a global top 10 list of the most dynamic SD-WAN companies – the only UK business to make the list.

The feature article cites data from market research company HIS Market, listing the revenues of the highest earning SD-WAN vendors for the third quarter of 2017, regardless of whether they are merely resellers or whether they actually have deployable CPE (note Huawei in the list).

## Innovation and Promise

But while big industry names like Cisco dominate revenue figures purely due to acquisition of existing providers, Evolving Networks have been recognised in a wider look at the market focussed more specifically on innovation and promise.

And so, we’re ranked alongside the likes of Juniper and HP as one of the most dynamic SD-WAN providers in the world, for our focussed approach delivering a much-needed network service in the UK market.

As the only UK company in this global list, it’s also good news for UK business and our entrepreneurial telecoms sector. And it must make us the most dynamic SD-WAN company in the UK!

## End User Experience is Paramount for SD-WAN

EM360 have recognised our focus on enabling businesses to provide good quality, reliable connectivity to their users, regardless of where their apps lie. Private cloud, public cloud, locally hosted or a hybrid, end users don’t care about WAN connectivity – they just want to be able to get on with their job and use the apps they need.

Delivering them the access to achieve this, wherever they reside, is paramount to successful SD-WAN deployments.

## The Only Software-Defined Network Ecosystem

They go on to note our approach in building an ecosystem of platforms and services to support SD-WAN as a Service in the UK.

Without this ecosystem, and the extra levels of intelligence, redundancy and orchestration that it brings, SD-WAN in the UK can be complex, expensive and unwieldy.

## Much Deserved Recognition

This is great news, and testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire Evolving Networks team, as we innovate with new SD-WAN features, and show the growing market that there is a different, more intelligent way of networking.

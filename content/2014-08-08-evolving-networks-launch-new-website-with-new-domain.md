Evolving Networks are pleased to announce the launch of our brand new website registered to the new domain name evolving.net.uk. This is a much needed development for the company and the new site showcases the extensive growth of Evolving Networks since the previous redesign in 2011.

The complete redesign is dramatically different from the previous site and features a fresh modern look suitable to the innovative nature of Evolving Networks as a whole. Careful considerations have been made into the sites navigation, content and imagery in order to make the visitor’s journey simplistic yet enjoyable.

With the new website comes new features including our brand new information video, a range of employee profiles, a current job vacancies listing, various navigational options and new ways to get in touch. We have also collated our blog posts, news stories and testimonials into one easy to view section.

Along with the fresh look was the need for a new domain. Nic Elliott, Technical Director at Evolving Networks said “The decision to host the website under a new domain name was a necessary step in the right direction for Evolving Networks and signifies the company as a registered, reputable business ISP in the UK.”

Evolving Networks are extremely pleased with the finished product and after months of hard work, feel the new website is reflective of the level of service we deliver to our customers.

We would urge all of our customers and visitors to take a look around at the new pages, watch our video and enjoy the site as much as we do.

_Our Marketing team would love to hear your feedback on the new website. If you have any comments please email <marketing@evolving-networks.co.uk>. Thank you._

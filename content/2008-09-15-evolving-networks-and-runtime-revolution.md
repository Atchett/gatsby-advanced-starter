Evolving Networks, the leading UK provider of bonded ADSL solutions has recently completed the installation of a bonded ADSL internet connection for Runtime Revolution Ltd. The need to source new connectivity was driven the business relocation to new offices in Edinburgh.

As developers of the world renowned Revolution suite of user centric development tools, Runtime Revolution rely on their internet link to conduct and maintain their business, regularly needing to upload large files to partner companies and distributors across the globe.

The unique needs of their industry meant that when sourcing an internet link, Runtime Revolution had to be diligent in their choice of both technology and supplier.

The need to upload large files regularly, in addition to servicing the internet and email needs of their staff, meant that a high capacity leased line was a very expensive option. Having received quotes from a number of suppliers in the bonded ADSL sector, a shortlist was drawn up of two companies whose technology fitted the bill.

Runtime Revolution settled on Evolving Networks because of their commitment to excellent customer service, demonstrated through the sales process and subsequently the delivery of a workable solution, on time and on budget in their new offices.

Having installed, tested and handed over the bonded ADSL solution, Evolving Networks continue to work closely with Runtime Revolution to ensure that link performs to optimum levels.

Commenting on the agreement Nic Elliott, Technical Director, Evolving Networks said, ”putting bonded internet links into demanding environments is what we are all about, this deployment was typical in that high capacity internet download requirement were coupled with the need for occasional large FTP uploads. Where traditional bonded ADSL providers might have struggled we delivered a solution tailored precisely to the customer’s needs”.

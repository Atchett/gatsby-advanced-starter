It was announced yesterday how the government are planning to share the money promised to 10 UK cities to allow them to create superfast broadband networks for homes and businesses.

The 10 cities and how the money will be distributed:
  
 London &#8211; £25m
  
 Leeds & Bradford -£14.4m
  
 Belfast &#8211; £13.7m
  
 Manchester &#8211; £12m
  
 Bristol &#8211; £11.3m
  
 Cardiff &#8211; £11m
  
 Edinburgh &#8211; £10.7m
  
 Birmingham – £10m
  
 Newcastle &#8211; £6m

New culture secretary Maria Miller has said that the chosen cities “produced comprehensive plans, which will turn them into digital leaders, and give their local economies a real boost”. This is a plan targeted to have superfast broadband for 90% of premises by 2015.
  
However, this is not a new announcement, Shadow Minister for Media and Telecoms, Helen Goodman said “this is the government disguising its failure to roll out universal broadband by making yet another re-announcement about the super connected cities programme”.

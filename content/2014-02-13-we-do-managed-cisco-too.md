After nearly 6 years of successful trading in the bonded connectivity market, one thing we haven’t really shouted about is our ability to provide fully Managed Cisco services to our customers.

The reason for this? To put it simply, we’ve been too busy selling resilient bonded connections to UK businesses!

Our investment into making our connectivity options the best they can possibly be, by working on new services such as QoS and Bandwidth Amplification, has meant our Managed Cisco services have taken a back seat.

We already have a number of customers with one of our Managed Ciscos on site and in more recent times, as we’ve supplied more and more multi-site companies, we’re getting more demand from a multitude of customers.

So if you need a managed VPN for your network that has 2 sites, 200 sites or thousands of remote workers, we can provide a fully managed WAN built on secure Cisco technology.

Or if you’re just one site, a Managed Cisco firewall from us will protect your business from external threats. We understand that smaller businesses might not have the time or money to invest in in-house expertise so we’ll look after your firewall for you.

We happily manage, maintain and monitor our firewalls so you don’t have to!

We’ve got a dedicated website for our Managed Cisco, packed full of useful information which you can access by <a href="http://managedcisco.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.

If this sounds like something your business could benefit from, whether you’re an existing customer or you’re a business looking around for better connectivity with extra benefits, get in touch with us and we’ll see how we can help! 0330 55 55 333.

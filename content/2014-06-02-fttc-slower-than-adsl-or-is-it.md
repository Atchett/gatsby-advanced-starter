After writing a recent blog post on <a href="/fttc-slower-than-adsl-it-happens" target="_blank">FTTC being slower than ADSL</a>, I had an interesting conversation with Mark Heath from Increase Broadband Speed who we have been working closely with on testing our services.

After explaining the situation to Mark and discussing the interaction between copper and FTTC, could these results not be true? It is true that the further you are from the cabinet the more throughput you lose&#8230;but it should not get to the point of actually being slower than ADSL.

Worst case scenario is that FTTC should be equal to and not slower than ADSL. Could this be the BT DSL checker showing incorrect results?

We are still learning the best ways to deliver our customers the most accurate estimated throughputs we would expect to see. This is why we always prefer to set customer expectations by delivering conservative throughput estimations as previous blog posts describe.

The only way we are going to know the throughput for certain is by delivering a bonded circuit comprising of both FTTC and ADSL to see the results.

Please see future blog posts with the outcome of this.

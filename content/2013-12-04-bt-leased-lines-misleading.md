“When internet access is mission-critical to your business, you need a leased line.” – That’s the opening line on the Benefits page of the BTnet Leased Line section on their website.

As a provider of bonded internet connections, I have to disagree with that!  Putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky thing to do, no matter what kind of connection you have to the internet.

In fact, say that statement, or call it “tough” and “resilient” to the customer of ours who have had more downtime with their new 100mbps BT Ethernet line than the ADSL line sat next to it – you won’t get a favorable response, I’m afraid.

There’s a lot I find wrong with the way BT sell this circuit to customers on their website.  I think a lot of it is quite misleading.

The biggest of these things is the phrase, near the top of the list of benefits “And no reduction in speeds, up or down, no matter how many users are on at any one time”. Hmmm.

How can they say this? Do they not know how connectivity works – whether it’s a cable between two computers, or a connection to the internet sharing an entire network of computers?

Bandwidth is something that is shared all the time and although the word contention has entered modern parlance in completely the wrong way, the concept of sharing is somewhat easier to understand.

You can have an uncontended, dedicated connection of an amount of bandwidth to the internet.  That’s fine.  Let’s say its 100mbps, whether that’s a combination of FTTC, ADSL, EFM or Ethernet, but for the purposes of this argument let’s say it’s an Ethernet line, and that it’s supplied by BT.

The moment more than one person uses that connection at the same time, it’s shared.  Pretty much every company with more than one member of staff shares their internet connection in some way.  You may also share it with your servers, and these days, you’re sharing your computers bandwidth with that of the smartphone in your pockets, and everyone else’s in the room who is on Wi-Fi.

Now if each of those devices or people download something all at the same time, then they are not going to get 100mbps each.  The total amount of bandwidth coming from the network connected to that circuit can be 100mbps, but not more.  To say no reduction in speeds no matter how many users are on at one time is at best misleading and at worst an outright lie.

I’d like to think that a company like BT have some networking skills, and that their network engineers will understand the concepts involved here.  Maybe this is a result of the marketing department, but whoever is responsible, I don’t think it’s fair for it to be said and be used to win customers.

If it can be said for a leased line, it can be said for any internet connection.  If I start using 50mbps, and the guy sat next to me does the same, then the third person in the room is going to slow down both of us.  You don’t all get 100mbps each – in the same way that if everyone on the same street turns on all their taps, the water pressure will drop and slow to a trickle.

So don’t be won over with false promises that Leased Lines are the holy grail of internet connections.  For a start, there are plenty of things that can go wrong with them and at that point your SLA isn’t really worth a lot, but the bandwidth won’t behave any differently.  If you use it all and saturate the connection, the individual speeds of data streams will start to slow down to compensate and fit.

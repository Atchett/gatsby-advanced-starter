  Another important milestone has been reached with bonded ADSL connectivity from Evolving Networks. Kimbolton School, based in Cambridgeshire, has this week achieved download speeds of over 100Mbps.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Kimbolton School have been a customer of Evolving Networks since 2010, and earlier this year upgraded their 4x bonded ADSL connection to an 8x bonded ADSL solution with the intention of increasing the available bandwidth on site.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Their 4x bonded ADSL service saw download capabilities of around 40Mbps, but due to the demanding needs of their users and the changing way that schools use the internet, they required a connection even more robust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With the upgrade to an 8x bonded ADSL connection, Kimbolton School also became the first customer of Evolving Networks with a virtual bonder running on their own VMware infrastructure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Technical Support engineers at Evolving Networks have optimised the 8 lines and calibrated the virtual bonded internet gateway so the school can achieve speeds of over 100Mbps. Operating at full capacity the connection has the ability of reaching 115Mbps.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is a significant development for Evolving Networks and a great success for bonded ADSL. Speeds of this nature are usually only achievable with NGA technologies, such as using combined fibre circuits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Single ADSL lines operating at optimum performance can normally only reach download speeds of around 24Mbps. With Evolving Networksâ€™ ability to bond any number of lines, with any variation of individual capability, Kimbolton School are able to reap the benefits of an already available traditional internet technology without the need for fibre.

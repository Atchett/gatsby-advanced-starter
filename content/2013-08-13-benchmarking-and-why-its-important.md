We put all of our bonded internet connections through a rigorous benchmarking process once installed.  We have to wait for the initial 10 day training period of ADSL and FTTC circuits to complete and then we embark of a series of tests, some invasive, some not, on the fully live connection.

All of these test results, as well as key metrics from the individual circuits themselves end up in our eViewLive database, so we know what the connection should look like at all times.

Of course we wouldn’t need to do this in an ideal world, but we live in the world of ancient copper lines, and the networking “fudge” that is DSL.  Because of the way that DSL lines work, they have to adapt to changes in conditions, which means potentially slowing down if there is a problem.

What we don’t want is a customer reporting slow speeds to us when we could have detected the problem first.

So by regularly comparing the benchmark data to the live figures generated all day long by eViewLive, we can intervene and catch problems in the act, or even before they really become a noticeable problem.

I think it’s a really important part of our service, and along with live traffic figures and historical usage graphs, it’s a key part of eViewLive, and one that continues to save us and our customers time and money.

We’re great believers at Evolving Networks of stopping problems before they happen, and designing systems and working practices that help us do that.  The benchmark is a great example of that, and hopefully as part of updates to the customer facing parts of eView in the coming months, we’ll be able to share some of that benchmarking data with you, so you can see exactly how we manage your connections, and keep everything as fast as it can be.

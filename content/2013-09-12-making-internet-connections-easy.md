We have always prided ourselves on being able to sell something that’s complex and clever behind the scenes, but easy for the customer to use and buy.

Did our customers need to know exactly how we bonded 2x SDSL with 2x ADSL to give a “best of both worlds” connection of high upload and high download? No, not really – they just needed to know that it would work, be resilient and that we would take ownership of any and all issues it might face.

Building eViewLive was a big part of that desire to make things work and give customers that “warm fuzzy feeling” (actual customer quote!) that they are being looked after with minimal input from them.

We’ve moved on from bonding SDSL and ADSL together and have embraced every new broadband and fixed line circuit as they have come along.  We still bond combinations of circuits based on business need and to reduce risk.  We still utilise all available bandwidth rather than just operating failover connections and we still proactively monitor every connection, including circuit changes and live traffic, in order to detect problems before they become a problem.

But where do we go from here?  We’re already poised to embrace the next generation of internet circuits, whether they are GEA FTTC, FTTPoD, or an as yet unnamed technology of tomorrow.  But that’s just keeping up with the times.  Businesses will always want more bandwidth and always want resilience, but now we can offer something on top of that too.

Our new hardware allows us to remove another headache from businesses – what happens when you legitimately use all of your available bandwidth?  It’s not a fault, the bandwidth is there, so use it.  If you do want more, then buy some more and we’ll add in another circuit seamlessly, but what if it’s just those few times a day that you hit the peak?

When you do, the other things you are trying to do on your internet connection go slow, or pause, because they are stuck in a traffic jam.

This is where QoS comes in.  Quality of Service on any bonded internet connection – something no other provider can do.  Do you need to know how it works? Probably not.  But will it make your life easier? Absolutely.

No more complaints from users that web browsing is slow when someone else downloads a big file.  No more hosted desktops and terminal services that are laggy or jerky no matter what else is happening on the connection.  No more robotic or stuttering VoIP calls when someone sends an email with a large attachment.

So feel free to ask us how it does work, but in the scheme of things, you and your business are more concerned about how you will benefit from it and how it will make things “just work”.

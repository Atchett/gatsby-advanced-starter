Once the first line has gone live (see [Part 5][1]), it is time for the first line of the connection to head into the training period. This is the time where we set a benchmark of how the line should perform, which then helps our engineers to spot any problems that may arise.

In the case of our Chairman, he had a brand new FTTC line installed along with his old ADSL line that we migrated and upgraded to FTTC before bonding the two. As we deployed this with a phased approach, the first line was made live and then entered its training period.

The training period lasts for 10 days and during this time the sync and throughput of the line fluctuate so the optimum stable rate can be determined. This may cause the line drop as it will sync higher than it is stable at.

Once an optimum stable rate has been established and the training period has completed, the line will then sync at its fastest stable rate. If the line drops below this it will be flagged up to our engineers via eView Live and then they can identify and fix any potential problems.

In the case of our Chairman, his first line has an optimum stable rate of 10Mbps down and 1.5Mbps up.

In Part 7 of our story we will talk about these speeds in more detail and how they perform for our Chairman’s needs overall.

Evolving Networks welcomes the news that red tape is being cut in order to allow more of the country to experience faster internet connections.

It’s still going to take some time, but by allowing tier 1 connectivity partners like BT and Virgin Media to more quickly establish new cabinets in rural areas and not-spots, businesses are going to see an improvement in the internet connections available to them.

Because we can always provide and bond the fastest connections available in any given location, if you operate in one of these areas, you can benefit now from having an Evolving Network. A bonded internet connection from Evolving Networks takes whatever broadband technology is available to you and makes it resilient, fast and business class.

We can take multiple ADSL lines and create a great business internet connection for you now, knowing that when the new cabinets have been installed, and the latest fibre broadband is live, we will upgrade you for free so that your connection has the added bandwidth.

So don’t wait for the upgrades, and suffer with slow and unreliable broadband. Get a business grade [bonded internet connection][1] from [Evolving Networks][2], that is future proof, portable, and contention-free.

eView Live from Evolving Networks delivers total connectivity surveillance 24 hours a day to all Evolving Networks customers.

At Evolving Networks we believe that knowledge is everything. Your internet connection is critical to your business, and we know how important it is to ensure that your [bonded internet solution][1] is always operating at 100% capacity.

If you have a bonded ADSL connection from another supplier can you be certain that all lines are up 24/7, can you be certain that all lines are pulling their weight &#8211; delivering as much capacity as possible to the bonded link &#8211; can you check and verify this from any device, anywhere in the world?

If the answer to any of the above questions is “no”, you need to experience eView Live from Evolving Networks.

_100% Visibility of your Bonded Internet Connection – 24 Hours Per Day_

Customers of Evolving Networks can use their personal login details to access the eView Live platform 24 hours per day to collect real time facts and figures. eView Live consistently refreshes its data scan to provide you with the most accurate figures on the internet.

Whether your business has a twin bonded ADSL or a [hybrid-bonded][1] ADSL2+, FTTC & EFM connection, eView Live delivers 100% real time visibility, 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world. 

_ProActive Monitoring & PreFault Analysis_

Originally developed by Evolving Networks as an internal monitoring & diagnostic tool, eView Live now delivers unparalleled visibility to customers across the UK.

But it is more than just a status check, anyone can set up a ping test to see if an individual link is responding. eView Live monitors critical health check data from every Evolving Networks tail connection and is able to identify changes in key metrics and flag up to our support staff any changes that might impact line performance.

Such pro-active monitoring means that our Incredible Support Team have incredible knowledge and are able to “nip in the bud” any line faults before they manifest themselves in a performance drop or loss of sync on an individual line.

Bonding across multiple tails gives you resilience, but ProActive Monitoring & PreFault Analysis from eView Live goes further still – ensuring optimum performance on every bonded link, all the time.

Normally if you want to get QoS on an internet connection or a point to point link, you have to buy an expensive Ethernet circuit – commonly known as leased lines.

These, ISPs will tell you, are the only circuits that can do the prioritisation necessary for certain applications and to make sure other traffic doesn’t crowd out the important stuff.

Others will sell DSL with a specific portion dedicated to VoIP traffic (Voice Assured) to try and mitigate the problems you can see when using a single connection for everything, but with those and with Ethernet you still don’t have any real resilience and Ethernet is expensive if all you want is VoIP.

Well, we have been working hard to overcome these issues and can provide QoS on any of our internet connections.

With big advances in hardware and some clever algorithms built into our bonding platform, we are now seeing live customers with true Quality of Service on their connections.

And we’re not just talking about basic traffic shaping – throttling a particular type of traffic.  We’re talking about true packet prioritisation based on traffic class.

We already have our [new branded hardware][1] on site with a number of customers now, specifically to improve their experience with time sensitive applications and therefore not have to waste money on additional circuits or leased lines.

We have customers using VoIP and Remote Desktop/Terminal Services that are able to also download or upload whenever they like while protecting the calls and terminal sessions from lag and drop outs.

It’s hard to put a cost on that kind of improvement when you’ve been dogged with problems for months or years, and maybe you’re in a location which doesn’t even have very good broadband.

To provide a bonded internet connection complete with QoS is definitely the future.  Providing internet connections that “just work” is where we want to be and this is a massive step forward.

We’ll talk more about QoS and its different features in a future post and how what we are doing is at the top end and vastly superior to what you could achieve yourself, even with a specialist appliance on site.

As a Peterborough based ISP, last week we attended the Destination Digital even hosted by the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme.

The government funded programme is all about providing local SMEs with access to better digital technologies, for example faster connectivity and better software technologies.

The basic outline is that businesses in the Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire regions can apply for up to £3000 towards implementing better digital technologies.

In the case of improving internet connectivity, the programme will cover installation costs of up to £3000 as long as the chosen provider meets the following criteria:

  * A minimum of 20Mbps with the ability to configure or upgrade this to 30Mbps
  * A doubling of speeds compared to their current business connection

The Connecting Cambridgeshire programme is part of the wider BDUK Voucher Scheme and the money available will vary from location to location, but in the Cambridgeshire region there is £4.5 million up for grabs. This means an approximate 1500 SMEs can benefit from the grant in the local area.

As Evolving Networks span the whole of the UK, we can deliver a faster connection to anyone located in the 22 SuperConnected Cities which are currently part of this scheme.

The scheme runs from February 2014 to March 2015 and has limited funds available. It works on a first come first serve basis so when it’s gone it gone and we would encourage any business interested that requires better connectivity to get in touch as soon as possible!

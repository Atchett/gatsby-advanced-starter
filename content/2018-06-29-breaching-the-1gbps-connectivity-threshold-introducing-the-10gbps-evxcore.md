It doesn’t seem that long ago we broke through the 100Mbps barrier to deliver customers 100bps+ connectivity.

Actually, it happened about 5 years ago, driven by technological leaps in both software and hardware.  Clearly network ports and chipsets must cope with 1Gbps to breach the 100Mbps barrier, but highly scalable network virtualisation software and processing hardware are also vital.

Having developed hardware and software to exacting requirements, upscaling processing power at the EVX level was all that was required to achieve higher and higher bandwidths.

This is an even more exciting milestone, having built the core infrastructure required to support multi-gigabit customer connectivity.

Whether it’s two or more Leased Lines, or multiple FTTPs, or a combination of both with FTTCs as well, we now have 10Gbps capable EVXcores – network virtualisation routers in our core infrastructure – to deliver multi-gigabit solutions to customers throughout the UK.

When investing in Gigabit connectivity businesses need reliability and resilience.  Taking our MultiVNO approach, enterprise connectivity is augmented with two Ethernet Leased Lines from two diverse carriers, logically forming a single, intelligent, multi-gigabit connection.

Two 1Gbps circuits become one single, resilient, Software-Defined 2Gbps service.

Once again bringing datacentre-grade technology to the enterprise edge, in order to serve SMEs and large corporate clients, with what they really need – great connectivity.

Whether its for simple Direct Internet Access, or as part of a multi-site SD-WAN, flexible Multipath Ethernet connections can be used in any combination, delivering any amount of bandwidth and any VLAN configuration, Layer 2, Layer 3 and Hybrid.

Existing MPLS services can be integrated whilst still in contract, while aggregating further connections and applying Zero-Touch QoS to the entire SD-WAN.

And if you want to breach the 10Gbps barrier as well – we’ll build the network for you!

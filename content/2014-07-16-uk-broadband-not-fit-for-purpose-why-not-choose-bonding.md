The BBC published an interesting article this week (take a look [here][1]) about The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) comments that broadband in the UK is lacking ambition compared to other nations.

FSB are urging the Government to deliver every UK home and business a minimum of 10Mbps by 2018/19, opposed to current plans for 95% of the UK to get a minimum of 24Mpbs by 2017.

A key point they highlighted was that many small businesses in the UK are still suffering from dial-up speeds and only 15% are very happy with their current broadband set up.

They are urging the Government to reconsider their plans and think the fibre rollout should be focusing predominately on business parks across the UK. They recommend ‘a new ambitious national broadband strategy’.

The key point is that businesses in rural and city settings alike are still suffering from poor connectivity which is restricting their growth. Considering 94% of small businesses think their internet connection is critical for their success you’d have to agree.

Of course BT, who we must not forget have been awarded every contract for the rollout, have defended their progress so far. They say that over 70% of premises have access to fibre connectivity currently which should rise to 90% over the next two years.

But it appears this progress has mainly benefited residential users – there are many business parks still left in the dark. Perhaps this has something to do with the financial gain of enabling a cabinet for 200-300 homes rather than 40 to 50 businesses?

The underlying message is that the UK is currently expecting 95% of premises to have access to a minimum of 24Mbps by 2017 which is a bit behind when it comes to other nations…for example South Korea who are anticipating everyone to have 1Gbps connections in the same timeframe.

But the most significant part of this story for us is that there is an alternative option for businesses that isn’t to just go to your local council or get an expensive leased line (which the article rightly points out is not ideal for small businesses who can’t afford it). The answer? Bonding!

We’re able to supply to businesses anywhere in the UK and can bond any number and any combination of fixed line technologies so there’s plenty of options available. We can improve throughputs, add resilience and protect you from downtime.

We’ve also been on the case with the DCMS to try and get bonded ADSL eligible for Connection Vouchers as well and are so far making good progress. Nothing is confirmed 100% yet, but it means there could be more support available for smaller businesses.

Bonding is often ignored and that is because there are providers out there who don’t do it effectively. But we’re different. We have a private network and actually buy more bandwidth than necessary to ensure our customers get the best connectivity all the time. We use our own hardware which is configured in house by our experts, the same experts who man our Technical Support desk. We’ve got features like [QoS][2] and <a href="/bandwidth-amplification-gets-even-smarter" target="_blank">Bandwidth Amplification</a> and are constantly working on new ways to make connectivity even better.

So maybe the FSB is right and the Government need to rethink the broadband strategy to match the progress of other nations. Or maybe the current scheme is going well and could finish ahead of schedule. But for right now and for the foreseeable future, Evolving Networks are going to be here. Able to bond in the most effective way possible to give any business the connectivity it needs.

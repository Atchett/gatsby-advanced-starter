Everyone hates VPN! Ensure secure access for homeworkers with Evolving Networks.

Spider Eye are a long standing customer of Evolving Networks. As a typical computer animation business they deal in large files, so the ability to send and receive large volumes of data is vital to their business. Not everything about Spider Eye is typical though, you won’t find them in Clerkenwell or Islington, the business relocated lock, stock and barrel to the most westerly town in England, St Just in Cornwall some years ago.

Hence the long association with Evolving Networks, who have been providing high capacity, resilient internet connectivity to Spider Eye, allowing them to inhabit their professional space in the industry from the delights of the west country since 2011.

Through the relationship, Spider Eye have enjoyed free, seamless upgrades to their connectivity as more advanced technologies have become available, resulting in their current multipath ethernet service delivering aggregated capacity via multiple FTTC circuits, meaning that their connectivity actually outperforms that used by the majority of their London based rivals.

Evolving Networks are always looking to improve both the quality of their customers’ internet connections as well as our relationships with our customers. As such, a discussion about the wider networking requirements of Spider Eye uncovered the need for home worker VPN access to office based systems for key workers.

Evolving Networks have delivered high capacity internet connectivity to the home for key personnel, with an EVX on site delivering a layer 3 point to point connection to the head office, ensuring secure access to the systems required, without the need for a cumbersome VPN connection.

If your business needs home worker access, there is a low cost alternative to that VPN solution you have been putting off implementing – call Evolving Networks today to find out how SD-WAN from the UKs network virtualisation pioneer can save you time, increase productivity and mean the end to your VPN pain!

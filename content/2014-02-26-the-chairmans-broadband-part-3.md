As [Part 2][1] of our Chairman’s Broadband story was about placing the order for the first line, Part 3 is all about the deployment process.

The way we have deployed the Chairman’s connection is staggered, this means that we are putting the fresh PSTN in and getting the FTTC live first before migrating the second line over. We do this as a standard procedure so that the customer/end user does not lose connectivity as a result of any issues or a violent training period.

Though it is rare, the SIM Provide codes for this order failed. Unfortunately, it happens.

SIM Provides are never 100% guaranteed and that’s just the way it is with BT. We are never given a reason for the SIM Provide failure regrettably, which means we can never proactively avoid the failures.

Nevertheless, the PSTN line has now been installed so it’s all about pushing for a date.

The standard lead times for an engineer to come to install FTTC on a line is 15 working days. The date of this FTTC installation has been confirmed as the 4<sup>th</sup> March, which is only 11 working days from the date of the PSTN installation.

We normally get them in earlier than the quoted 15 working days, this comes as a result of our relentless chasing of carriers. But it’s not always the case and we won’t guarantee a lead time.

Based on this we can now schedule in the date of the equipment configuration, shipping date and deployment date.

Normally the configuration date is three working days before the installation/live date. The shipping date is two working days before the live date and the arrival date is the day before the live date.

Part 4 of the Chairman’s Broadband story will focus on the configuration of the equipment in the Evolving Networks lab!

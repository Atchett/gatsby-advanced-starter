By tomorrow evening we will find out what the chancellor has decided to go into this year’s autumn statement. With George Osborne already throwing a helpline to Britain’s cash struggling small businesses this week, it will be interesting to see if the chancellor goes ahead with plans to redirect money made from the savings in the welfare budget, as well as other areas to start work on the 40 ‘Priority Schemes’ which have been lined up. 

Other measures which will form part of the Government’s growth strategy include Government guarantees worth up to £40 billion to high street banks’ lending money to small and medium sized businesses. This will lead to the banks being able to borrow money more cheaply on the markets as a result of the taxpayer guarantee, it is then expected that the banks will cut the interest rates for small firms by roughly one per cent. 

With the price of such interest rates predicted to soon drop, and news that pension fund money is expected to be used to build new broadband infrastructure, now is the perfect time for small businesses to start considering investing in improving their connectivity to take advantage of the latest technological developments, such as [Cloud Computing][1].

The few weeks over the Christmas and New Year period is often described as the annual “Network Freeze”. This is because during this time some ISPs won’t allow customers to place orders for new lines, get upgrades or support due to a number of festive related factors.

Of course, the festive period means holiday for most. With staff shortages and the inevitable cold bug flying around, some ISPs will hold all orders until the New Year.

There’s also the weather issue. We’ve seen prolonged periods of snow in recent years, all of which affect the telecoms industry and disrupt engineers work. In turn, delaying customers from getting new lines and upgrades.

Well, at Evolving Networks we don’t really think these issues are a huge problem. We’re not going to be imposing a change freeze and we’ll be running our network as normal over the festive period.

Often ISPs will not operate their support lines, this isn’t exactly great for their customers and we don’t want to have to do that to ours. It’s all still easily manageable and we’ll try our very best to get orders placed during the Christmas weeks.

Of course, BT play a huge part in the “Network Freeze”. Often it will take longer to get an installation date during this time because BT have to deal with a back-log of Christmas orders first before setting new dates.

But our service will still remain the same. We’ll still welcome new orders and upgrade requests because we have the ability to manage it. Our support lines will be manned according to our <a href="/end-of-year-round-up-festive-opening-hours/" target="_blank">Festive Opening Hours</a> and we won’t be announcing a complete freeze at any point.

We can’t guarantee an installation date because that would be irresponsible, but there is no chance we will completely freeze our customers placing orders.

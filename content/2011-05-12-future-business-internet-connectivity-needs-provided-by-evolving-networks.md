By and large UK business leaders are dissatisfied with their ADSL links.  News of &#8220;superfast broadband&#8221; is all well and good, but studies show that stability and quality of connection are more important than outright speed.  Evolving Networks believe that speed and stability are both vital elements of a busienss class connectivity solution, and both come as standard with every Evolving Networks link.

Evolving Networks commit to provide fast and resilient, carrier diverse, bonded ADSL and cross platform superfast broadband connections (including FTTC and EFM) to meet future business needs.

With a contention free, datacentre resilient private network, Evolving Networks provide industrial strength bonded broadband to the UKs most demanding businesses.

Nick Johnson, Managing Director &#8211; “Businesses want a secure and reliable internet connection, and that’s what we provide.  Evolving Networks’ strategy is built around taking whatever technologies are available and bonding them together through our private cloud.  So businesses that are used to hearing about superfast broadband speeds can achieve those speeds today even if they don’t have the latest EFM, FTTC and ADSL2+ in their area.”

“We’re different from other bonded ADSL providers, in that we couple a contention free, resilient, carrier diverse private network with virtualised high availability bonding at the core, with our own advanced monitoring platform eView Live.  That’s why we have customers like BAE Systems and CSC, who rely on us for their bonded internet connectivity, as well as Vindis Group, Manchester City Council and the Health Protection Agency.”

“Our customers need to know that we are giving them the bandwidth they need today while growing with their business tomorrow and providing whatever services are available.  We can bond any technology available through our private network, so customers right now can benefit from extra speed and stability by mixing technologies like ADSL2+ and FTTC, all fully managed and monitored.”

Evolving Networks are a specialist provider of bonded broadband connections and cloud services to small and large UK businesses.  Every bonded ADSL connection comes with eView Live which allows customers complete visibility of their connection with real time throughput speeds, live graphs and dials, and historical usage data.

eView Live keeps a constant eye on every node in the network, and automatically detects faulty lines and performs remote diagnostics on them, meaning faults are eliminated, and true proactive support is delivered.

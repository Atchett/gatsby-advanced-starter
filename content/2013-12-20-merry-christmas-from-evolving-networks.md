It has been a very busy and successful year for us and we would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

2013 has brought with it some very exciting things for us, which you can read about in our <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Merry-Christmas-from-Evolving-Networks.pdf" target="_blank">Christmas Newsletter</a>. This year we celebrated our 5th birthday, moved to larger offices, saw the arrival of brand new equipment, recruited lots of new staff and had a number of great successes in the Evolving Networks lab.

Due to our advanced technologies and superior bonding capabilities, we are now able to offer a range of products and services that can transform a business’ internet connection. This includes VoIP Ready Connectivity, Bandwidth Management & Acceleration (True QoS & Bandwidth Amplification), Remote Workforce Solutions and much more. And, as always, we are still continuing our research and development efforts in house, all with the aim of making internet connections even better for UK businesses.

So for us its roll on the New Year. We can’t wait to see what 2014 brings and we are set for another period of growth as our service offerings continue to expand.

We&#8217;re only closed for the 3 Bank Holiday days over the festive period, so as always please feel free to get in touch with our specialists.

Merry Christmas!

So, my first post for the newly revamped Evolving Networks blog.

Whilst the blog is new, it’s just one more thing that we are doing to engage even more with our customers (both existing and potential).  And that got me thinking about a number of things that have changed recently, and how really nothing has changed at all.

Since 2008 Evolving Networks have delivered resilient bonded ADSL connections to businesses of all sizes.  Our first ever bonded ADSL connection is still in place, still passing CCTV traffic through a VPN over a triple bonded ADSL connection.

We started off selling high quality, uncontended bonded internet connections for demanding UK businesses.  What are we doing now?  We sell high quality bonded internet connections for demanding UK businesses.  Progress, what progress?

Well, we believe in keeping the clever stuff behind the scenes.  Your bonded internet connection plugs in and works, straight out of the box.  That’s important to us.  We then optimise, benchmark and continually monitor each component line and proactively fix any issues as they occur (and we’ll even catch most issues before they become full blown faults).

All our customers know is that their internet connection is online, and that performance is good.  The fact that our network is uncontended, or that our core bonding infrastructure is running on fault tolerant, high availability VMware across two live datacentres is irrelevant to most of our customers.

So with that in mind, what has changed?  New hardware arriving was a big moment for us.  We have designed and manufactured our own boxes and these are now out there in the field working hard at customer sites.

Why did we go to the trouble of doing this?  The evolving UK communications landscape is the driving force.  Back in 2008 we bonded ADSL & SDSL connections to deliver a highly resilient bonded internet connection into Portsmouth Dockyard for BVT.  This harnessed the fastest available tail technologies to deliver a resilient and superfast internet connection.

This bonding of the fastest locally available tail technologies has been our guiding principle ever since.  However, with SDSL giving way to EFM and the roll out of FTTC gathering pace, more new technologies on the horizon and the associated inevitable lowering of the price of Ethernet, our customers demand that we bond more and more technologies to give them the resilience they require, and of course, that we don’t skimp on the bandwidth.

New hardware however is only half the story.  When bonding FTTC lines together, or bonding FTTC & ADSL, or bonding ADSL with EFM or Ethernet services (all of which we are doing right now) we also needed to significantly improve the algorithm that sits behind things.

New hardware, supported by the improved algorithms has driven our rollout of cross carrier and cross technology bonded solutions, delivering lots of bandwidth and huge resilience to businesses for a fraction of the cost of a leased line.

But coming back to that question of the clever stuff that we keep hidden, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> have we managed to squeeze all the available bandwidth out of a bonded ADSL and FTTC connection, for example?

The nuts and bolts are not for me to explain, but we have cracked QoS and Compression over bonded internet connections.  Years in the planning, developing and testing, these advanced features enhance our ability to extract optimum performance from bonding ADSL, FTTC, EFM, Ethernet or any combination thereof, from any major UK carrier.

This ability to look at any given location in the UK, ask the customer what they are looking for, and to tailor a bespoke bonded internet connection to meet their needs is nothing new.

It’s what Evolving Networks have always done.  The uncontended private network delivery mechanism hasn’t changed.  But the clever stuff that sits behind our connections has developed massively.  We won’t stand still, we will keep working hard to ensure you have access to as much bandwidth as you need, in a highly resilient solution, wherever you are in the UK.

Keep watching, because we are not done yet, there will be some big announcements over the coming months.  But through it all we’ll keep providing simple to use resilient internet connections that just work.  Nothing changes really.

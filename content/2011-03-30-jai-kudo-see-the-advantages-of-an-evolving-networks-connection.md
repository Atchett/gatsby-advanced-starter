Jai Kudo is the latest business to sign up for a truly bonded ADSL connection from one of the fastest growing ISPs in the UK.

Jai Kudo is a sophisticated, fashion forward eyewear designer who appeals to both genders. Jai Kudo is a big name in the eyewear industry and is always looking for new ways to be innovative in their market.

Evolving Networks differ from many businesses in the ISP industry, we truly care about giving every customer the best service in the industry. When Jai Kudo got in touch with a question about hosting, Evolving Networks were happy to go the extra mile to specify a bonded internet solution for Jai Kudo.

Jai Kudo was switching to a hosted Microsoft Exchange email solution and therefore needed a high quality internet connection that would support the new way of working.

After consulting the bonded ADSL experts at Evolving Networks, it was suggested that Jai Kudo install a twin bonded ADSL solution. Their new bonded ADSL solution delivers Jai Kudo a high quality, uncontended service, with built-in resilience. 

In addition to providing the bandwidth required for hosted email, a further reason for Jai Kudo to signing up for a bonded ADSL connection with Evolving Networks was the 24/7 monitoring service, eView Live. 

eView Live was created by Evolving Networks engineers to provide full transparency and to monitor every bonded connection all the time. eView Live delivers the reassurance that your bonded ADSL connection is working to optimum levels at all times.

This is unlike any other product in the bonded ADSL marketplace. Evolving Networks know how important the internet is to your business and we will always strive to offer you the strongest connection in the industry.

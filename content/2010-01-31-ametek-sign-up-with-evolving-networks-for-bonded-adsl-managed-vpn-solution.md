Evolving Networks, the leading provider of business grade bonded ADSL, are pleased to announce a major new contract win.  AMETEK have signed up for a bonded ADSL managed VPN point to point solution to provide their office network in the UK.

AMETEK is a leading global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with annualized sales of $2.5 billion.  The deal further reinforces Evolving Networks’ position as the bonded ADSL supplier of choice to the defence industry in the UK.

Under the terms of the agreement, Evolving Networks will provide a fully managed VPN service, linking offices in the south of England with secure site to site data links.  Connectivity to each site will be established through resilient bonded ADSL connections, delivering Ethernet connectivity over copper infrastructure.

In addition to the bonded ADSL local tails, site to site data will be routed through a private uncontended network to minimise latency and deliver a business class connectivity solution for onsite users.   Full visibility and management information will be made available via the eView Live platform, which will be modified to provide a raw data feed into the AMETEK intranet.

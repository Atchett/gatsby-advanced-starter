_“We had a bonded connection with our previous supplier, but after they did an upgrade it only seemed to make things worse and the service level we received was very poor. Moving over to Evolving Networks was easy and simple and our three bonded ADSL Max connection, being used across five offices, has stayed very reliable and working properly._
  
 _At first, the connection was a little jumpy, but the knowledgeable technical support staff at Evolving Networks ensured it was fixed immediately after the end of the initial training period. They’re always very proactive and responsive which means you don’t have to chase for an update or a fix. With our previous supplier there was a time when we had to wait six months for a fix._
  
 _The Evolving Networks connection is more expensive than our previous bonded solution, but I believe you get what you pay for. Even when we’ve been really busy we’ve seen no drops and it’s been spot on so far. The eView Live monitoring tool is very useful and definitely adds to the value for money._
  
 _Overall, I am really impressed and after looking to increase our speeds for some time, I have a very good opinion of Evolving Networks and the connection they have delivered to us.”_

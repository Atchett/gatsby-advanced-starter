As a leading provider of innovative networking solutions, Evolving Networks are at the forefront of the bonded ADSL market in the UK.

Whilst we exploit the very latest technology to deliver bonded ADSL solutions that give our clients internet connectivity they can rely on, we try to be much more than just an ISP.

We work with our business clients to identify both cost saving and revenue generating opportunities for their bonded ADSL solutions.

One of the key ways in which we are able to add value in this way is by assisting with business continuity solutions.  When an organisation has more than one site there are a number of IT challenges that are raised, [how to share data between sites][1] clearly chief among them.

Something that often slips under the radar however, is the issue of business continuity.  What if the worst were to happen?  In recent years this has been thrown into sharp focus, with the floods of 2007 leaving many businesses unable to function.  It is imperative that your business can continue to function even if one office were to be out of action.

Bonded ADSL solutions offer a degree of flexibility in this situation that leased lines are not able to match.  Quite apart from our expertise in the delivery of managed VPN solutions for multisite organisations, Evolving Networks are specialists in providing bonded ADSL solutions that are able to take up the challenge of delivering both a primary internet link and a business continuity solution.

Even for organisations with a heavy duty leased line infrastructure, there can be role for bonded ADSL solutions to play.  For example, consider the recent case of a large not-for-profit organisation who contacted Evolving Networks.

Although seven sites in London and the Midlands were connected with 100mbps Ethernet links linked through the JANET platform, there was no business continuity plan in place.  Evolving Networks undertook an audit of the existing network infrastructure and it was clear that there were pain points in the network.

Through the strategic positioning of bonded ADSL links at four key sites, Evolving Networks were able to alleviate the bottle necks, thus improving the end user experience by providing “over flow” internet connectivity.  However, as a managed service provider, spare config files are held that enable the links to be used as a failover business continuity solution in the event that there is a serious failure with the primary network.

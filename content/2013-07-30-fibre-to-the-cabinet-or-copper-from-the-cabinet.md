Fibre Broadband. Infinity. Lightning fast.  ISPs are putting a lot of stock in FTTC, the latest flavour of broadband from BT, which promises faster upload and download speeds.

What ISPs seem to be doing though is treating it like it’s the holy grail, like it will solve everyone’s problems.  We think it’s pretty good, but at the end of the day it’s still a DSL product, and what we’ve learned is that single DSL lines need to be improved upon.

FTTC in the UK is actually based on a standard called VDSL2.  Like ADSL Max and ADSL 2+ before it, it’s based on the copper lines that run into your building.  The way it differs from ADSL is that the run of copper cable between the green cabinet and the telephone exchange has been upgraded to fibre optic cable.

BT Openreach are slowly moving round the country replacing and upgrading the green cabinets at the end of people’s streets.  Because the copper cable now only runs from the cabinet to the premises, the DSL technology needs to be installed at the cabinet, rather than at the exchange.  This is why it is not a quick conversion process, and even in a few years’ time, not all of the country will have access.

DSL requires a “connection” across the actual circuit itself, and because the speed can vary, this connection can drop and reconnect again.  The drops we are used to seeing, or “resyncs” are a normal part of making sure that your line is the fastest and importantly the most stable connection that can be delivered.

What we do at Evolving Networks is bond multiple lines together, preferably of different types, so that we can smooth out the resyncs and changes in speed, delivering a bonded internet connection that is fast and reliable.

FTTC, like ADSL is there to be improved upon.  Not everyone gets the fastest speeds, and it’s still a DSL connection which can go down or change speed.  We always recommend bonding more than one line together, so that you get a business grade connection, and the bandwidth and support you deserve.

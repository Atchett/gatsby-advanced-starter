Futaba Industrial is just one of many businesses who are making the change from a single internet connection to a resilient bonded ADSL connection with Evolving Networks.

Futaba International is the UK arm of a Japanese automotive manufacturer located in Foston, Derbyshire. Futaba is committed to delivering low cost products on time and to the highest quality possible.

Futaba had been struggling previously with a legacy leased line, which proved to not be up to the high demands of the business. A change was needed to deliver a faster and more cost effective internet connection.

Evolving Networks is the leading business provider of industrial strength bonded internet connectivity. The fast growing ISP is able to bond multiple lines together delivering bonded ADSL, ADSL2+, FTTC, EFM or Ethernet depending on the client’s specific need. 

The 4 line bonded ADSL connection that Futaba purchased was the fast and cost effective solution they had been looking for. All Evolving Networks bonded ADSL solutions are contention free and have no usage caps. 

In addition to the performance benefits offered by Evolving Networks, eView Live will be constantly monitoring Futaba’s bonded ADSL solution. eView Live has been created and developed by the experts at Evolving Networks to monitor every bonded internet connection and provide real time facts and alerts to our customers and network technicians. 

So if your business needs a fast, resilient internet connection that is monitored 24/7, then make the same decision as Futaba International, bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks.

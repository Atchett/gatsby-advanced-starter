As the world prepares to have all eyes on London this Friday for the Olympic Games, experts are warning businesses that their [internet speeds may not be able to compete with the speeds of the Olympians competing][1].

Plenty of Olympic records will be broken at the already hailed ‘Twitter Games’, but in the virtual world, it looks that UK internet traffic records are going to be shattered.

With the arrival of fans and spectators coming to the capital to watch, tweet, upload videos and so forth.  The influx of spectators and those of Game officials, organisers and 20,000 media representatives has led the Internet Service Providers’ Association to warn that a “massive hit on the infrastructure” is likely.

At Evolving Networks we have prepared ourselves for the oncoming Olympic period by increasing the internet bandwidth to our [private network][2] dramatically.

Other networks and servers across the UK internet may not have prepared as we have for the increases in traffic, therefore we can’t guarantee that customers will not experience speed fluctuations during over the next few weeks.

But, with such a massive increase to our bandwidth, we are ensuring that our network is not the cause of any slowdowns and our customers get a connection of which they are used to from Evolving Networks.

If you have any questions about the network or your connection during the Olympic Games, [please get in touch][3] or call our UK based experts on 0330 55 55 333.

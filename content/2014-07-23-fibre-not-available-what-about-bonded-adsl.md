Last week a customer with an 8x bonded ADSL connection from Evolving Networks saw download speeds of over 100Mbps. Proving that bonded ADSL is still very much a viable option for businesses struggling to find a better source of connectivity.

Some people believe that ADSL is now an outdated technology and not up to technological advances in comparison to fibre. And with delays and problems with the current fibre roll out scheme, many people are believing they will have to settle for a poor performing single line or invest heavily in an expensive leased line.

As we already know fibre isn’t available everywhere and for certain areas there isn’t even an indication of when it will become available. Also, like any other fixed line technology, fibre lines can go down and there is no in-built back up system to keep you connected. So before fibre seems like the be all and end all, we’d urge people to consider what else is out there.

What about something that may save you money and boost your throughput whilst improving resilience and reducing downtime? What about bonded ADSL? Firstly every premises in the UK can access ADSL where there is a phone line. With Evolving Networks’ ability to bond any number of lines, you’re not limited to a set speed.

A great example of the benefits of bonded ADSL for us is a customer of ours who are a school. Last week they breached speeds of 100Mbps with their 8x bonded ADSL connection. The school previously had a 4x connection but decided to upgrade the connection earlier this year based on the growing needs of their students and teachers.

The school have been with us for around four years now and wanted to upgrade the connection in order to increase the available bandwidth on site. This is a fantastic development for bonded ADSL as it shows these speeds can be reached without the need for fibre.

That’s not to say that we should dismiss fibre or the advantages that it can provide because here at Evolving Networks we bond FTTC as well as ADSL, Ethernet, EFM and any other fixed line technology. We also offer our customers a future proof promise so when fibre does become available, we’ll upgrade one of the existing lines free of charge.

The simple fact is that it doesn’t matter where you are based in the UK, if your company is big or small and whether you have access to fibre or not, we will always have a connectivity solution to suit your needs.

We love bandwidth at Evolving Networks.  We love supplying high bandwidth connections to our customers and allowing businesses to make use of services that might otherwise be unavailable to them.

Pushing the envelope in terms of higher and higher throughputs does raise some interesting factors that we need to address around the thorny issue of throughput speeds.

We’ve blogged in the past about speed test sites and how to verify exactly what capacity a bonded connection is delivering but it is the issue of expectation setting that I want to deal with today.

New customers typically get in touch with us to ask what throughput speeds we would be able to deliver at their location.  This is where it can get confusing – as connectivity in the UK is very much a location dependant technology.

As we have been doing bonding for a very long time we have always looked to give meaningful advice based on a potential client’s geographic location.  We have occasionally lost out to less scrupulous competitors, some of whom would even go so far as to promise customers the maximum throughput of an ADSL 2+ line multiplied by the number of connections (48mbps from a 2 x bonded ADSL2+ service, sounds good hey!).

When speaking with potential new customers we set speed expectations based on the information contained in the BT system, and from this we extrapolate conservative throughput estimates during the pre-sales process.

When setting these expectations, we have two constant touchstones – we try to be both realistic and conservative.

Our ability to be accurate with throughput expectations before actually delivering a service is based on both clever technology and lots of experience.  We know that it is better to promise 20mbps and deliver 22mbps, than promise 24mbps and have a disappointed customer.

As for how we actually arrive at these expected throughput figures, well that depends on what initial information we are given.  If we have a postcode to work from we can give you a pretty clear idea of throughput on a range of bonded ADSL options.  If we have PSTN numbers to work from, we can be that little bit more precise.

Once the bonded ADSL service is installed, it goes through a rigourous test & optimisation process, during which our specialist bonded ADSL engineers ensure that every ADSL line is performing to its optimum level, and that the bonding is tweaked to support your specific requirements.

Obviously, this benchmarking and optimisation process can only happen once the component ADSL lines have completed their training periods, but even during training, we can weight our bonding algorithms to deliver the best service level possible.

Of course, once the bonded ADSL service is installed, tested, tweaked and benchmarked, eView Live our bespoke monitoring system is constantly keeping a close eye on every bonded connection we supply.  And the visibility delivered via eView Live is what also allows our customers to see exactly what level of throughput they are getting on their new bonded ADSL service.

Evolving Networks believe in a number of things, and the transparency delivered to our customers by eView Live is a crucial pillar of what makes us the bonded ADSL supplier of choice to the most demanding businesses in the UK.

We know that it is not in our interests to set unrealistic expectations with potential customers at the pre-sales stage.  For one thing, we know that both us and our new customer will be able to see exactly what level of throughput their new bonded ADSL service is delivering, via the eView Live system.

There are some more complexities to bear in mind, as we continue to push the envelope and develop the technology we need to look at how advancements such as QoS and Bandwidth Amplification impact both delivered speeds and initial expectation setting.

We’ll look at these on future blog posts, but for now rest assured that Evolving Networks will set realistic expectations when it comes to delivering a bonded ADSL, or other bonded internet service.

Its better that way.

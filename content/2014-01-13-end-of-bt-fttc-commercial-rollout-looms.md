Spring 2014 – that’s when BT’s “commercial rollout” of FTTC ends.  So what does this mean?

How has the FTTC rollout gone so far and what do I do if I don’t have FTTC by the spring?

BT Openreach actually brought forward the installation of FTTC by 18 months from the original end date, which has meant that lots of premises have had FTTC made available to them quite a bit earlier than originally predicted.

So that’s good news.

Here’s the bad news.

The commercial rollout of FTTC only covered about 30% of all of BT’s telephone exchanges.  Ouch.

Of those Exchanges that have been (or are about to be) enabled, not all of the actual cabinets have been/will get upgraded.  Bigger ouch.

This means that if your neighbour’s a few streets away have had FTTC for a year or so, and you don’t, then even if you share the same exchange, you probably won’t get FTTC.

What we have seen for a while now is that BT also prioritise residential areas over commercial ones.

This fits with this idea of not upgrading all the cabinets, but extends it further, and for 2 reasons.

  1. BT Openreach’s plan for making FTTC pay for itself means that they chose cabinets that were in areas that made economic sense. i.e. density populated areas.
  
    Business parks and commercial areas don’t have many potential subscribers compared to a large residential estate so commercial areas are ignored.
  2. It appears that those areas that are closer to the Exchange, and therefore getting a better than average ADSL service are also not prioritised.

We’ve seen evidence of both of these practises, resulting in a doughnut of areas around enabled exchanges where cabinets are enabled, and pockets left where business parks are located.

The cynical among you may also consider that BT make quite a bit of money from big fibre Ethernet services to businesses, and so don’t want to upgrade those areas for fear of losing the revenue they get for those.

But hang on, the commercial rollout is ending – is that it? Where’s my FTTC?!

Apparently from that point on it’s all down to the money in BDUK, which as we understand it, will not help everyone.

The chances of people in that inner ring of premises close to an exchange with a pretty reasonable ADSL2+ service getting a chunk of this public money is very slim indeed.

A well organised, vocal group of rural NIMBYists in the rolling hills of the back end of beyond will definitely get more chance of receiving the public money in the BDUK pot, even if all it means is that BT do the work anyway.

We like FTTC but it’s far from the panacea that it is portrayed as, and you have to get underneath the numbers quoted to really understand the rollout, particularly from a business perspective.

We bond FTTC lines, and bond FTTC with ADSL for extra resilience, but one thing is certain and that is we are going to be bonding ADSL lines for businesses for some time to come, even if they are in so-called “fibre-enabled” areas.

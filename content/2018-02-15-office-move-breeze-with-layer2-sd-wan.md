So, after 5 years it was time to move on from Datum House, our home since 2013. We had a very enjoyable time there, with the offices serving us well, but when our lease expired we decided to take the opportunity to move into larger premises that could continue to support us through the next phase of our growth.

We’re not moving far, just across the car park in fact, from Datum House (number 3) to the newly named Nexus House (number 7).

Whilst we’re not moving a long way in terms of distance, Nexus House gives us substantially more space, and the opportunity to significantly enhance our software development lab, as well as a larger NOC and meeting spaces.

The move also gives us an opportunity to see things from the other side – we get calls every week from businesses planning an office move, and here at Evolving Networks we eat our own dog food!

Enter a resilient layer 2 SD-WAN connection between the two offices.

The technical details can be expanded upon another time – or call and speak to us if you desperately want to know the nitty gritty – but the ability to deliver resilient connectivity at the new location (a resilient mix of ADSL & FTTC, naturally) and then extend our LAN via layer 2 through our Intelligent Network Fabric made the transition between the two offices a piece of cake.

New hosted VoIP phones appeared on the LAN in the new office, and the physical transitioning of PCs and network appliances was no more difficult than walking them across the car park. No change of external IP and no downtime.

It was interesting being on the customer side of things for a change, we get now just how stressful office moves can be, but we can at least make the issue of transitioning your internet connectivity easier, be it ADSL, FTTC, EFM or leased line. Please give us a call if you are considering an office move, and we’ll talk you through now easy we can make it.

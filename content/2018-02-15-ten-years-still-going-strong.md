Where does the time go? In 2008 Evolving Networks opened our doors and began selling bonded ADSL solutions to business in the UK who wanted a little more throughput and resilience than they could get elsewhere.

Those heady days of bonding ADSL Max Premium and delivering upload capacity of 1.2mbps, or even more, really do seem like a lifetime ago.

What we have never done is rest on our laurels. While other ISPs looked on bonding as a stop gap solution, we never bought into that theory.

First it was ADSL 2+ that was going to be the “death of bonding” offering mind bending speeds of 24mbps download and 2mbps upload. Who would possibly feel the need to bond more than one of those?

Then it was VDSL, or FTTC that was going to be the panacea. This mindset led to a lack of innovation in the ISP industry – our competitors either blindly sold the new technology or hawked leased lines to their customers, value for money be damned.

Of course, as each new technology arrived, we bonded it, we made it faster, more resilient, more responsive to business needs. Last year we delivered our first gigabit and bonded FTTP connections.

We have always worked to extend and develop our technology. We were first to prioritise critical business traffic, such as VoIP or cloud apps, long before anyone else was thinking in this way.

We built our own network, the UKs first multi-VNO SDN platform, to deliver a secure, resilient and low latency underpinning to our software overlay.

Others now see the benefit of this approach, but they simply do not have our decade of experience in providing software enhanced connectivity solutions in the UK.

This experience and expertise is being recognised now, both in the customers that we are winning, and the awards we are being nominated for, as well as in the industry press.

We think all businesses should have an internet connection that is agile, intelligent, resilient and tailored to their needs. And we would love to talk to any existing or potential customers – come and see us in our new offices, meet the team, have a cup of tea and see how we deliver the best network connections in the market!

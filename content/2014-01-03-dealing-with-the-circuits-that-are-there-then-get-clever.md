It’s the expectation game again.  The trouble with the underlying network in this country (well there is definitely more than one problem), is that it is very much location dependant.

To be honest it’s nigh on impossible to make a network that isn’t, and it takes a lot of money to do so.

If your office is in the middle of a field, it’s going to cost more to have faster connections than if your office is in an urban sprawl and really close to a major carrier’s Point of Presence.

For most of our customers this means the local telephone exchange – a truly antiquated term now, but one we still cling to.

If your distance from the exchange (or cabinet too with FTTC) is great, then your line speed is going to be lower than someone closer.

The trouble is, we are already doing whatever we can if you are in that situation.

  1. Make the broadband circuits as healthy as we can
  2. Run them through a private contention-free network
  3. Bond them together to multiply the speed and cut downtime

Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we just can’t meet customer’s expectations of how fast a connection should be because what they want would cost 20 times what they currently pay.

“I should be able to get X mbps” is the classic line.

All estimates from Openreach say otherwise, and our own modems tell us a pretty accurate measurement of the line length and capability.  There is nothing in this situation that we can do, other than:

  1. Install more lines
  2. Install a different type of circuit (more expensive)
  3. Get Clever

Here’s where we are currently focusing our efforts.  Delivering a raw unfiltered, unlimited, uncontended internet connection is one thing, but how about augmenting that connection? How about amplifying the bandwidth?  How about giving high priority to the things that matter, and at the rest of the time giving free reign to everything else?

We can only deal with what circuits are available on site, but the platform we have built, and the hardware that we manufacture are now allowing us to harness the power that we have engineered in.

Why not take that power and clever engineering that enables the resiliency and speed of bonding internet connections and point it at where you need it most?  Enhancing your experience.

  1. Make web browsing snappier
  2. Make VoIP calls flawless
  3. Download and upload files quicker than your lines allow
  4. Use Terminal Services lag-free
  5. Save bandwidth by saving information locally
  6. Filter it if you want to
  7. Know what’s going on at all times

Some of these things are available right now, others are in the pipeline.

Our Bandwidth Amplifier literally creates extra bandwidth out of thin air, allowing you to get more bang for your buck.

Our QoS system can sort out your VoIP calls and other critical cloud systems right now.

We’ve had enough with what’s available – it’s time to enhance it.

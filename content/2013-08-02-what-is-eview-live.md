<a href="http://bit.ly/1hJQSKk" target="_blank">eView Live</a> is an online monitoring tool we provide as standard to everyone of our bonded Internet customers.

We also use the <a href="http://bit.ly/1hJQSKk" target="_blank">eView Live</a> system as part of a larger monitoring system which gives us the upper hand fixing faults compared to other ISPs.

Customers can see in real-time the amount of traffic being passed over the connection 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

**How is this helpful for the customer?**

For example if youâ€™re a single user in an office of 30 users and Internet connection seems slow, with any other connection without a monitoring system there is no way to tell the difference between a connection that is being saturated by the other users onsite, an issue with part of the onsite LAN network or a genuine speed issue with the connection.

The live state of our connections is monitored from three separate servers both internal and external to our network. The state is shown clearly on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1hJQSKk" target="_blank">eView Live</a> site.

Again this is useful in many ways. Is the connection down or is there a fault with a device on site.

Customers or resellers with many sites can see the connection status of all their sites at a glance.

**As a company grows and increases the amount of users, firstly congratulations, but a question to consider is will you need more bandwidth? If so, how much?**

<a href="http://bit.ly/1hJQSKk" target="_blank">eView Live</a> shows your total usage hour by hour and day by day. The increase in traffic is monitored and informed estimates can made if and when extra bandwidth is required and by how much. Without this information upgrade requirements can often be a stab in the dark.

We will be going in to further details regarding all the aspects of <a href="http://bit.ly/1hJQSKk" target="_blank">eView Live</a> monitoring service in later posts.

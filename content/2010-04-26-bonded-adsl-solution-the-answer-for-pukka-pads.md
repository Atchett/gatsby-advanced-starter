Evolving Networks are pleased to announce another new bonded ADSL customer, with Pukka Pads joining their fast expanding list of customers.

Evolving Networks are to supply bonded ADSL to their central UK distribution centre.  With distance from the local exchange meaning that single ADSL connectivity delivers a relatively slow sync speed, Pukka Pads were looking at a very expensive leased line option in order to connect to head office in Poole.

However, bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks was selected as the option that can deliver the necessary upload speeds and very fast download capacity to enable the Pukka Pads VPN link, and all delivered for a fraction of the price of a leased line.

In addition to the speed improvements delivered with the triple bonded ADSL solution, the fact that the bonded ADSL link is delivered with a static IP range means that there is no problem running the site to site VPN, and that resilience is vastly improved.

Gerry White of Evolving Networks said, “The Evolving Networks bonded ADSL customer list includes some of the most famous companies in the world, and we welcome the addition of another well known name.  We look forward to supplying Pukka Pads with top quality bonded ADSL, and to adding value to their infrastructure”.

Evolving Networks are pleased to welcome another new customer, with Wardray Premise Ltd signing up for a bonded ADSL connection at their offices in Thames Ditton.

Wardray Premise is a long established company specialising in the manufacture of all type of Radiation Shielding for medical and industrial applications.  With a long heritage, global reach and impressive customer list, decisions about crucial factors such as internet connectivity are not taken lightly.

With the need for faster and more reliable internet access than was provided by the existing single ADSL line, Wardray embarked on a search for a viable alternative.  Evolving Networks, as the acknowledged leaders in the field of industrial strength bonded ADSL, were contacted.

After a diligent process, the market leading bonded ADSL technology of Evolving Networks ticked all the boxes.  With a private network delivery model, true bonding and unlimited internet access as standard, Evolving Networks offer a clear alternative to mass market bonded ADSL offerings.

This, coupled with the ability to use the same system to generate management reports for the bonded ADSL connection made the decision of which bonded ADSL supplier to work with easy for Wardray Premise.

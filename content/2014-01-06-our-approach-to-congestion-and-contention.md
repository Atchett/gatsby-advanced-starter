This one’s an easy one – we don’t like either!

We treat any slow down due to congestion or overcrowding as a fault. If we detect congestion at your exchange, then we will push BT until it’s fixed. And we push them hard!

Our network is run so that you get what you pay for – an experience that shows no slowdowns at different times of day, and no loss of data.

 _Do You Manage Your Network?_

You bet we do. We closely monitor and control our network and traffic flow to make sure that the experience is consistent and good.

We have automated systems with important jobs like keeping servers on line and rerouting traffic if a core link should fail.

We think Network Management is important, and gets a bad name when called things like “traffic management”. Good Network Management involves making sure links stay uncongested, servers and routers stay online and traffic continues to flow.

It means buying the right amount of bandwidth at the right time, and always knowing what is going on.

 _Technically Speaking, Are Your Links Contended?_

Technically speaking, if you don’t live on your own, even your home internet connection is contended! Contention as a word has become quite loaded. It has a history of being the scapegoat for poor performance and was only originally meant as a way of defining the differences between the very early broadband products available from BT.

Any circuit used by more than one person or customer is contended, whether it’s used to connect to BT at the circuit end, or through our network, or on a carrier link or peering point out to the internet.

We use the phrase contention-free or uncontended to mean you’ll never experience a slowdown unless there is a major fault.

Most other ISPs operate at peak capacity most of the day, and even institute complex rules and allowances once you’ve downloaded an amount, or at certain times of day.

On our network, you won’t experience contention or congestion. Of course we don’t have an individual circuit for you all the way out to the internet – that would be not only expensive, but would not allow any prospect of resilience.

We buy enough links to keep the service up as long as possible, and enough bandwidth so that everyone gets enough.

Unlimited downloads and uploads, no slowdowns, no filtering, no usage caps, no unexpected costs.

That’s the only network that you want to bond internet connections with. An Evolving Network.

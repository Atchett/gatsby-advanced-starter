We have bought our first of the new internet domain names!  The domain name extension we thought was most relevant of the new batch was .technology, so we have bought some to represent various features and products.  Check out [http://bondedfttc.technology][1]

So, what is all this about then, with these new domain names?  Well for a long time now we have been used to sticking .something on the end of a web address.  But the list of things that that “something” can be, has been very restricted until now.

.com, .net, .co.uk – all of these are now part of the everyday lingo needed when navigating the internet.  Most people will realise that there are geographic domains (top level domains or TLDs to be precise), such as .de for Germany, .fr for France, and of course .uk for us!

Some of these have been exploited by their countries of origin – for example, .to is the official international TLD for Tonga. They quickly realised that other people, especially English speaking peoples globally, would like a .to domain because it’s the word “to”, so decided to open up registration internationally.

The same happened with Columbia a couple of years ago, with .co to represent companies in much the same way as .com and .co.uk (or .co.any-other-extension).

The situation that has been brewing for a while now is the development of, well, any word you can think of as a domain name.  It’s been through many years of discussion and development internationally and a lot of lawyers will have earned their fees for negotiating whether Google should get .search and Amazon .book.

You have to have deep pockets to even be entertained with the notion of having your own TLD, and of course you need to be able to make your money back selling subdomains (the bit before the .something).

Loads and loads of new domains are coming out as a result.

You can buy a .camera, .singles, .plumbing, the list goes on.  Every month or so, more and more will become available.

It fundamentally changes how we will go to websites, and how they will look in search engine results, so we need to start getting used to it.

For now, we’ve bought some .technology domains, as it seems to make sense when talking about compression technology or QoS technology, or just simple bonded ADSL technology.

It might make things easier, but it might not! We’ll see how it goes.

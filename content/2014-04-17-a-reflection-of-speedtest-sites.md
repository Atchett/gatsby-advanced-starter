I spent some time with a customer last week.  We get on very well and he has been with us for years, using two bonded ADSL lines in the depths of the South West (that’s as far we go in terms of identification I’m afraid!).

What I thought would be interesting is to relate a conversation about throughput (or “speed” as he put it) as we had an exchange that I found very illustrative.

The customer in question uses the bonded ADSL connection we supply to support general business browsing, VoIP and file transfers.  They also run an eCommerce website that is critical to their business.

The website is hosted offsite with a large hosting provider.  All very normal.

As we have known each other for years I often spend time in the office, and will get the laptop out and reply to emails after meetings.  I was doing this whilst the marketing manager was uploading some new product shots to their webserver.

In the course of this fairly usual transaction there was a slight delay in response from the webserver.  In fact, one page took about 2 seconds to load.  As I happened to be sat behind him, he asked me if their connection was working alright because…. “it seems a bit slow”.

I immediately loaded eView Live and we looked at the connection.  Green lights all round, and very little traffic going over the bonded ADSL connection.  The built in Healthcheck system also indicated that all component ADSL lines were sync’d as they should be and all critical measures looked good.

Now this is where the conversation got interesting.

What then happened was that the marketing manager loaded up a consumer speedtest website – the type that are sponsored by ads, you know the ones.

He proceeded to run a check on the bonded connection and he got a result of 2.7mbps per second.

He then “filed” this with other results, which showed a wild spread of results.

Interestingly I was able to verify that the speedtest did indeed generate 2.7mbps download performance on the bonded ADSL service, as I still had eView Live open on my laptop.

This was in spite of eView having recorded usage earlier in the morning in excess of 5mbps, so the capacity was clearly there, just not being used by the speedtest website.

I took the opportunity to access a large file and downloaded it from the web.  With no download managers involved, I watched eView Live to see what happened.

What I saw was a download graph that jumped to 13.5mbsp immediately, and stayed there consistently until I halted the download a couple of minutes later.

So the connection was clearly delivering some 5x the download capacity that was being shown on the speedtest website.

But what I found really interesting was the immediate questioning of the broadband in this scenario.  Remember, this is an office full of people, all using the web, sending and receiving emails, and I had seen two people having simultaneous and separate Skype sessions not 5 minutes earlier.  What had happed was a page on a hosted webserver had taken a couple of seconds to load, and the immediate question was “is there a problem with the broadband”.

The answer was a fairly unequivocal “no” but it seems to me that the question should have been asked of the webserver – so I asked it!

It turns out that the website in question, and this is critical to the business remember, is hosted on the cheapest webhosting package available from that provider.

I should point out that I know the provider in question, they are a very large and well respected organization, there is no question of their offering as a substandard service.

But rather, it seemed to me that there was a false economy happening here.  A vital website deserves a Rolls Royce hosting platform at least as much as your staff members deserve a Rolls Royce internet connection.  (Maybe even more so &#8211; this is how you sell your products!).

I thought it interesting to reflect on why it is that people trust these ad sponsored speedtests sites so much, and why people are so quick to point the finger at their broadband when there are always other factors to consider.

We will continue to look to develop bonded ADSL testing methodologies and portals that deliver throughput checks that can be relied upon, and we will always work with customers – new, old & prospective – to identify the actual pinch points, and tailor an internet connection that really adds value.

At Evolving Networks we pride ourselves on the quality of not just our bonded internet connections, but in the quality of the support and diagnostics that go along with them. We will work with you to ensure that you get everything you need from your connectivity, all the time.

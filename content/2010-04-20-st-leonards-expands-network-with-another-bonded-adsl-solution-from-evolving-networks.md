There can be no greater testimonial than an established customer returning to purchase more connectivity, the situation that St Leonards School are in having made the decision to augment their network with a second bonded ADSL link from Evolving Networks.

Evolving Networks have been supplying St Leonards School with a bonded ADSL solution, used for their academic network, for many months.  So when the time came to upgrade the network used to supply high speed internet access to the residential buildings on site, there was a logical choice to make.

As a leading Scottish educational establishment, the provision of excellent internet connectivity into the learning environment initially led St Leonards to partner with Evolving Networks, the market leaders for industrial strength bonded ADSL.

The pastoral care of pupils is equally important and it is therefore necessary to deliver high quality internet access for students to access outside of school hours.  The second bonded ADSL solution will therefore be used to route internet connectivity to boarding houses.

Commenting on the deal Gerry White of Evolving Networks said, “we are always pleased to welcome new customers, but equally we are very pleased to strengthen our existing relationships and customers returning for more bonded links speaks not only of our excellent bonded ADSL offerings but also of the quality of our customer service”.

We’re seeing a turning point in the industry as we come to the end of the third quarter.

While Multipath Ethernet connections continue to be popular for businesses with a single site wanting resilient, high bandwidth internet access, we are seeing a clear trend in the desire to implement SD-WAN for multisite organisations.

Businesses have chosen MPLS networks for their WANs for a long time now.  But while the connectivity landscape in the UK has grown and expanded with new and higher bandwidth broadband circuits, and software engineering has taken huge strides in automating complex network orchestration, MPLS has stagnated.

We are now seeing demand increase month on month to replace aging MPLS WANs with SD-WAN.

As companies reach the end of their fixed term contracts (often 3 to 5 years), those responsible for IT are taking a second look at Software Defined Networking, and how it applies to the WAN.

3 years ago, SD-WAN was considered by many in the marketplace to be just about hype, even though Evolving Networks installed its first SD-WAN way back in 2013.

Now, as more and more installations take place, and the technology develops further, there has never been a better time to consider replacing static, single-line, inflexible MPLS with a resilient, multi-line Software-Defined WAN.

And it’s not just the larger corporates with 50+ sites who are seeing the advantages of switching to SD-WAN.  There is a large segment of the market operating on cumbersome and unreliable legacy VPNs.

Another growth area in the last quarter has been those businesses who haven’t ever taken the leap to MPLS but do have site-to-site connectivity through basic VPNs, either managed internally by their IT team or a local IT support company.

These VPNs tend to be flaky at best, and downright debilitating at worst.

SD-WAN is the successor technology to both these networking products – MPLS and VPN – and the benefits are clear.  Why have the hassle of managing your own VPN, when the very technology underpinning Multipath Ethernet connectivity is the tunnelling your VPN needs?

By integrating SD-WAN alongside local internet breakout, or even extending further with hybrid configurations including multiple discrete networks operating as Layer 2, Layer 3, or Guest Wi-Fi, businesses of any size can benefit from the Evolving Networks approach.

So if you are considering MPLS in place of your VPN – don’t!  Talk to us first and we’ll take that stress away.

And if your MPLS is coming up for renewal, then don’t just replace it with another MPLS WAN with poor reliability and no cloud access – take the leap to a fully managed SD-WAN as a Service from Evolving Networks.

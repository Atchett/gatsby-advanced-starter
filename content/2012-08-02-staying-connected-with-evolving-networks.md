In modern business it is vitally important to be in touch at all times, whether you’re in the office, on the move or you’re at home.  Therefore in an ever more competitive business environment staying in touch could be the difference between whether or not your business survives.

In today’s fast paced industries, communication and teamwork is crucial.  It is expected of everybody to be readily available at all times and by whatever means of which someone can contact them by.  With many devices now available to the public all with voice, email, social contact and video features, these will need to be available to employees so that they can communicate wherever they are.

A trend that is revolutionizing the way businesses operate with their employees is consumerisation or “bring your own device” (BYOD).  This is where employees bring their own technology to work instead of using the phones, tablet or laptops which the companies provide.  With many employees now owning more advanced devices than their employer, it makes sense for them to carry on using those devices at work (especially if the business cannot afford the upgrades).

BYOD is being embraced by businesses in a fast moving effort.  Earlier this year in May, Aruba published the results of their survey where 69% of businesses and corporations were encouraging employees to bring in and use their own devices at the office.

With more devices being brought into offices, there are several advantages and disadvantages to the influx of new devices.  With many positives and negatives towards BYOD in modern businesses, IT managers will have to weigh up whether BYOD could be the best solution for their business.

The benefits can have a massive impact on the businesses and the employees; however the complexity of the technology can be just as huge.

The main benefit of allowing employees to bring their own devices to work is that the employees are familiar with their products already.  Guaranteeing the business that their employees can integrate the device into their work life easily and without having to finance training days for the staff on their new devices.

With more devices being brought into the office, there will be more devices connected to the company’s connection and therefore the bandwidth will be more strained than ever.  With more devices eating up the bandwidth, this will cause employees to receive slower speeds when online and end up causing frustration amongst employees when the connectivity is not as fast as it once was.  The best solution to dealing with more devices eating up a company’s bandwidth is to install a hybrid-bonded internet connection.

Evolving Networks are the leading hybrid-bonded internet specialists, proving to every customer that by installing our unique connections to their office gives them far greater bandwidth, resiliency, download & upload speeds.

By bonding several technologies together to create a hybrid-bonded internet connection, this can give every business superfast speeds and higher resiliency than a normal connection can provide.
  
More importantly by installing one of Evolving Networks hybrid-bonded internet connections into a business, the connection provides far greater bandwidth which can comfortably handle all the new devices which staff are bringing in.

We want every Evolving Networks customer to be happy with their connection and a big part of making sure our customers are happy is to manage expectations properly.

Internet connectivity is a world of Up To’s and big impressive numbers. But the real question is what does ‘Up To’ actually mean, and will any of us ever actually see that big impressive number as throughput.

The answer is &#8211; unfortunately not.

FTTC, or Infinity as BT call it, is often quoted by ISP’s as being ‘Up To 80Mbps,’ but the truth is even if your exchange was in the reception of your office you wouldn’t actually receive that much throughput. This is just the nature of the technology, the theoretical maximum sync of FTTC may be 80mbps, but the most you will ever receive is around 80% of that figure. And the further away from the exchange you are the lower that throughput will be.

This leads us nicely on to how we come up with throughput estimates on our connections. Evolving Networks never quote ‘Up To.’ This is because ‘Up To 80mbps’ could mean anything from 1mbps to 79mbps, and how are businesses supposed to plan for that sort of variance.

When we check the available throughput at a location we can use three things to search for the available connectivity. These are, a PSTN number, the most accurate way, a full postal address, a bit less accurate, or just a post code, the least accurate way of checking. What the checker gives is a range, for example 2mbps to 6mbps, what we do is take a mid-point of that range, in this example that would be 3.5mbps.

By estimating in this way it means we take into account the difference between throughput and sync rates. It also means we can give potential customers realistic expectations which allow them to make more accurate decision on the connectivity that they need.

For example, if a customer is running a hosted desktop service and they need a certain level of upload, quoting an ‘up to’ figure doesn’t really tell them what they need. We want to work with all of our customers to make sure the connection they have is suitable for their needs and can grow with them.

What is also worth remembering with all broadband checkers is that they are a desk based survey providing an estimate. It is impossible to completely know the levels of throughput until a line is installed and DSL is applied. But this doesn’t mean we can’t find the most accurate way of estimating &#8211; we can.

And we are constantly trying to improve this process to make it even more accurate.

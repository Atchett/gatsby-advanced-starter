At Evolving Networks we consider the excellence of our customer support to be a critical factor in our sustained success. That means going the extra mile, and forming a partnership with our customers, helping where we can and advising where necessary.

When it comes to the “every day” business of providing support to our thousands of users, we equip our support staff with the most powerful monitoring and diagnostic tools. Our eView Live monitoring platform is the most advanced in the industry, and supports every aspect of our business and our customers’ bonded connections.

Each and every bonded connection we supply is monitored 24/7 by a combination of automated algorithms and common sense, thus ensuring you receive the best support experience possible. Whether it is a bonded ADSL connection or a bonded FTTC & EFM connection, our team is always monitoring it, ensuring optimum performance.

_One to one interaction with a UK based engineers_
  
At Evolving Networks we understand that customers are going to need one to one conversations with engineers who have access to the most advanced diagnostic tools in the industry. Our UK based engineers are always on hand to talk directly to a customer at any point during the working day about any aspect of their bonded ADSL connection. 

_eView Live_
  
Every Evolving Networks engineer and every one of our customers has online access to our 24/7 network monitoring platform, eView Live. eView Live tracks, tests and monitors each component line on a customer’s connection, providing real time facts and figures constantly. With both Evolving Networks engineers and eView Live consistently monitoring every connection that Evolving Networks provide, we are able to quickly find solutions to any connectivity issues – even proactively identifying & fixing potential issues before a fault develops – providing every customer peace of mind.

_Real Time Alerts_
  
If a single link within a bonded ADSL connection loses connectivity your bonded solution will seamlessly carrying on passing traffic over the remaining links, however our engineers will be alerted instantly. Once alerted to the issue, the engineer will immediately begin work on fixing the issue, keeping the customer informed at all times. 

_ProActive Line Interrogation_
  
Knowing as soon as a line drops is one thing, but how about stopping it from dropping in the first place? Ensuring that every customer’s connection is fully optimised is a core element of Incredible Support from Evolving Networks. eView Live connects to every modem on our network every day to interrogate the line, reading critical health data and alerting our engineers to any potential issues. This constant, pro-active approach means that many potentially serious broadband faults are identified and “nipped in the bud” before causing an issue.

_Evolving Networks’ Lab_
  
To ensure that our bonded ADSL customers get the best out of the equipment provided by Evolving Networks, every piece of kit goes through our own rigorous testing in our fully-equipped lab. Only after being signed off by multiple deployment engineers is the equipment delivered to customers so that they can begin using their new bonded internet connection.

One element of this assistance is to help diagnose customers’ problems with external hardware or software.

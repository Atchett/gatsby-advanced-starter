Nearly all businesses rely on the internet for their daily transactions and communications. In this environment, the argument for investing in the internet connection’s resilience, quality and security is irrefutable.

Evolving Networks offers an advanced solution to these demands: our ‘**We bond anything**’ business-grade internet connections. Each bonded solution delivers performance, flexibility and future-proofing together with resilience and security.

Evolving Networks **bond all connection types** – ADSL, FTTC, EFM, Ethernet, LLU – into a single, business-grade internet connection. Risk is reduced by eliminating dependence on a single link, while the available bandwidth is the aggregated total of all the links combined.

An Evolving Networks bonded internet connection provides **truly resilient** instant adaptive failover. If a single link within the bonded connection fails, traffic continues to flow through the remaining lines, with no intervention required, **no failover delay** and **no service interruption**.

Further resilience comes from **carrier diversity**; using connections from different providers such as BT, Virgin, TalkTalk or others. The chances of more than one carrier simultaneously experiencing core network or routing issues are slight, and the customer connection stays in service provided at least one carrier remains online.

Evolving Networks operate a **carrier diverse private network** which is **contention-free** with no throttling, usage caps or traffic shaping. Evolving Networks’ UK engineering team provide a 24/7 proactive monitoring and management strategy that pre-empts the escalation of most issues.

Network management is massively enhanced by <a title="eView Live" href="/advanced-network-analytics/" target="_blank">eView Live</a>, an advanced network monitoring platform developed exclusively by Evolving Networks.  eView Live brings full visibility to every connection by delivering real time circuit visibility and proactive health checking & alerting.

eView Live delivers full situation awareness to both customers and network engineers. It allows Evolving Networks to advise on when, and how, a bonded connection might benefit from upgrading. Statistical information about network traffic can be used to intelligently optimise traffic if required.

Enterprises of all sizes must have complete confidence in their internet connection and its ability to handle their current and expected traffic volume without interruption. Many also look for the best performance that internet technology can offer, to maintain their own edge in their market.

Evolving Networks’ bonded internet connection with its scalability, access to future technology and built-in redundancy delivers all of this: a fact which they back with their **99.9% SLA.**

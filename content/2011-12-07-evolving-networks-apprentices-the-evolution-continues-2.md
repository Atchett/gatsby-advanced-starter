Recently released figures show the shocking level of unemployed 16-24 year olds rising to a record high of 991,000, the equivalent of 21.3% of our future generation. It is clear that not enough opportunities are being made available to the next generation of workers.

However, Evolving Networks are trying to make a difference, having recently taken on three new apprentices in their Peterborough office. Nick Johnson of Evolving Networks highlighted why Evolving Networks are so dedicated to helping younger generations get a start in the industry, &#8220;workplace based Apprenticeships mean employers are able to mould younger workers to develop the skills they need to fit our very specific requirements. They are vital to the future of the business”. 

With this in mind Evolving Networks turned to JHP Training for assistance in recruiting apprentices and helping them acquire the skills needed to succeed in the modern business environment.

JHP Training is one of the UK’s largest and most successful employability and skills providers, providing staff training through a huge range of Apprenticeships, NVQs and foundation programmes across England, Scotland and Wales. With JHP’s assistance, Evolving Networks have hired several apprentices this year in technical, accounts and sales roles. 

All of Evolving Networks’ apprentices work for the company for eight months in order to earn both an important qualification for their career and vital experience in understanding their chosen career path, as well as gaining valuable experience.

One of the apprentices, Ryan Priestman, has developed an online forum for apprentices, www.apprenticeforums.co.uk. Ryan’s site launched only two weeks ago and has already attracted a significant amount of attention.

Ryan created the site because when he was searching for apprenticeships he had nowhere to go and get first hand advice from other apprentices his own age. Apprenticeforums.co.uk allows UK based apprentices to meet and discuss their apprenticeships, as well as sharing advice. The user friendly site allows for topics to range from jobs in agriculture to tourism as well as off-topic messages, ensuring a friendly feel. 

Ryan has already been contacted by Andy Sanders of Cambridgeshire County Council to feature in an interview alongside Nick Johnson for Apprenticeship Week 2012. The interview will take place in early 2012 and Apprentice Week 2012 is hosted from 6th-10th February with the aim of highlighting apprenticeships to employers, individuals, teachers, parents and the media. 

Ryan has recently been in contact with Ruth Badger, runner up of The Apprentice 2006, to see if she can help promote the site. Ms Badger has mooted the idea of mentioning the site to Lord Sugar to see if the Apprentice and Young Apprentice star can help promote such a worthy cause. 

With the potential backing from these two, [www.apprenticeforums.co.uk][1] looks to have as bright a future as all the apprentices currently working with Evolving Networks.

Ryan, who is in a customer service& sales position at Evolving Networks, said “The Apprenticeship enables me to learn whilst being in a working environment. With a supportive, hard-working team around me, it starts to rub off on me and spurs me on to do well”. 

Evolving Networks continue to support the apprenticeship scheme and are committed to ensuring their apprentices go on to learn the skills necessary for a bright career.

In this article I shall be listing several security issues that can affect cloud computing and highlighting some best practices that your business can conduct.

**_Every breached security system was once thought dependable_**
  
A large percentage of SaaS (Software as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) providers all confidently back the resilience of the systems, with some claiming that security in the cloud is much stronger than most other enterprises.

However going back five years to 2007, even Google was forced to make an apology due to the surprising collapse of its Gmail service in Europe. This example only goes to prove that not all businesses are safe and you will never know if you will have to make an apology.

Cloud service providers are facing similar security problems as other organisations. Industry analysts are starting to warn cloud service providers that the cloud is quickly becoming an extremely attractive option to cyber criminals.

**_Accepting the risks that come with cloud computing_**
  
As with every service, cloud computing users need to be cautious and understand the risks of data management in the new environment.

Companies should be cautious, for example, about how passwords are allocated, protected and changed. Cloud service providers characteristically work with a number of third parties, and so companies are advised to gain information about those third party companies which could potentially access their data.

One important consideration for cloud service customers, especially those responsible for complex data, is to find out about the hosting company used by the provider and if conceivable seek an audit of their security status.

_**Have cloud hosting companies taken security lightly?**_
  
Most SaaS offerings are constantly being altered and reviewed, a point which raises more security issues for customers. Companies need to know, for example, whether a software change might occur and alter their security settings.

Google has invested a huge amount of money and time into cloud computing, recognising that having a reputation for security is a key factor of success. However cloud computing is still a new frontier with little in the way of specific standards for security.

Even more salient, many are concerned that cloud computing remains in a developing stage and so the imposition of strict standards could do more harm than good.

Tips for companies using the cloud_**
  
• Look into whether your cloud provider is able to house your own security plans.
  
• Enquire into where your data is being kept and as to where the details of data protection laws for the relevant are as well.
  
• Carry out an in-house security audit of the host
  
• Draw a list of all the third parties that your company works with and if they have access to your data.
  
• Be cautious about updates and be definite that your staff are not accessing systems and areas for which they do not have permission.
  
• Instigate strict policies on passwords, their creation and management.

With all this said and done, we can expect great advantages and possibilities to come from cloud computing over the coming year. However as noted in this article, not all systems are secured and so you should not take anything for granted when it comes to your data, cloud based or not.

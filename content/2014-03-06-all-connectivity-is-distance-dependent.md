We have all seen the adverts for “superfast fibre broadband” and I think most of us have realised that this isn’t available to everyone. What’s even less understood is, when and if fibre broadband becomes available, it might not be as ‘superfast’ as we would all like it be to. It might not even be ‘fast.’

While checking the available connectivity for a customer’s site this week I saw that FTTC was available, more specifically the technology that BT call ‘Superfast Infinity’. But the customer was only able to get around 18Mbps, the same amount of throughput available as an ADSL 2+ line close to the exchange.

The reason for this is that all DSL connectivity is not created equally.

Just because two offices both have FTTC connectivity, it does not mean they will have the same available bandwidth. One connection may have a throughput of 60Mbps and the other may get 22Mbps. This is because all DSL connectivity is distance dependent, regardless if you have FTTC or ADSL, the further you are from the exchange the lower the amount of bandwidth is available to you.

It would be great if we all had an exchange next to our offices (even though they are a bit of an eyesore) but unfortunately that’s not the case. This isn’t to say that faster throughputs aren’t available a long way from the exchange, they just cost come at a premium of the financial kind.

A connection with 50Mbps download will be a lot cheaper next to a fibre enabled exchange cabinet than it will be in a rural location a mile from the exchange.

The property next to the exchange could achieve this amount of throughput on a single FTTC. Whereas the office a mile away from the exchange may require a 50/100 Fibre Ethernet Circuit which comes at an expense which is often unfeasible for a lot of businesses. This is frustrating for a lot of people but unfortunately this is just the nature of connectivity.

This is why at Evolving Networks we work to create cost effective connections for your needs, whilst making the most of the bandwidth that is available at your location.

Our bonded connections use different technologies to create the connection that suits your budget, and your needs.

It would be great if we could all get 100Mbps download throughput and it was £30 per month, but this isn’t the case.

All connections are distance dependent, whether that dependency is on cost or bandwidth, or both, and this isn’t going to change any time soon.

When reviewing their communications strategy businesses are faced with a potentially bewildering array of options.  With today’s focus on reducing costs and maximising efficiency, companies are increasingly  looking at bonding ADSL as an option.

As a mature technology, bonded solutions now offer a genuine alternative to expensive leased lines.  With faster deployment cycles than leased line alternatives bonding ADSL is also useful for companies looking to relocate or open new premises quickly.

There are however, a number of options to consider when looking at bonding ADSL to provide a business class internet link.

By harnessing the high download capacity of ADSL, bonding multiple ADSL lines together can deliver solutions with massive download speeds.  When bonding ADSL however, be careful to ask the right questions of your supplier about bonding overheads and actual throughput.  Typically, bonding algorithms eat into the TCP/IP layer and substantially reduce actual throughput.

The future use of the link is also a critical consideration when looking into bonding ADSL for business.  If you are intending to send VoIP traffic over a link built on bonding ADSL you need to consider the volume of call traffic and ask searching questions about the capacity of the bonding infrastructure to cope with such mission critical data.

Evolving Networks has put many years experience into the development of the UK’s most advanced bonding solution.   Bonding ADSL through a sophisticated High Availability central bonding cluster located in redundant data centres enables Evolving Networks’ business customers to enjoy leased line performance for a fraction of the price of traditional leased lines.

By using the GRE protocol within the algorithm when bonding ADSL, throughput speeds are massively enhanced compared to many bonding ADSL providers.  With the ability to specify and prioritise traffic within the bonded data stream, Evolving Networks are able to support VoIP and other mission critical traffic over a bonded link.

With a host of technological advantages, one of the fastest data networks in the UK and state of the art data centre hosting facilities, Evolving Networks are pushing the technology of bonding ADSL to the next level.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In January, Evolving Networks invited the Increase Broadband Speed team to the offices with the intention of raising the awareness of bonded connectivity in the UK business market.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After an extremely informative meeting, it was decided that Increase Broadband Speed would undertake an extended trial of the Evolving Networks service. The trial would provide them with the opportunity to discover the benefits of bonded connectivity through the Evolving Networks private network architecture.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Increase Broadband Speed have now been testing the connection since their lines went live in January. They have now published Part 1 of their review on their website and through their continuing testing, will later publish further reviews focusing more specifically on other aspects of the service.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently Increase Broadband Speed are testing a 2x Bonded ADSL service with Evolving Networksâ€™ exclusive Quality of Service (QoS) enabled. When fibre becomes available at their office location in the coming months, they will be upgraded by Evolving Networks and will continue on to test a bonded FTTC connection using the ADSL as a failover line.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Having an independent review of the Evolving Networks service offering is a positive step for the company and will be a valuable source of information when developing the business.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Customer feedback is always encouraged and is reviewed intensively in house with the purpose of constantly improving the Evolving Networks service offering wherever possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Evolving Networks would like to thank Increase Broadband Speed for their constant enthusiasm, valued feedback and for their eagerness to learn more about bonded connectivity for a wider audience.

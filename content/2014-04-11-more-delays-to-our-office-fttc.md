As I’ve already previously blogged, we have [FTTC in our office at Datum House][1] in Peterborough.  We’re in a reasonable size business park, and FTTC has been available here for over 2 years, but we’ve run out of capacity.

The date given on the availability checker was 2nd April for more capacity.

One of our Account Managers found with another customer that an apology had appeared on the checker (see his blog post <a href="/fttc-is-coming-or-is-it" target="_blank">here</a>), which was new, and now it appears the same has happened here.

I thought I would give it a few days before checking in case it took some time to update, but looking today and once more there has been a delay.

The date now says 7th May, and the apology has appeared – “Sorry your cabinet is temporarily unavailable, capacity will be restored as soon as possible.”

So, once more, we have to wait.  We already have 2 new PSTNs installed, but there is no point us putting on normal ADSL2+ because it’s a weak 2.5mbps and the whole point of the new FTTCs is to allow us to do more testing with high bandwidth connections.

We have many customers with bonded FTTC now and we’re starting to see good usage levels well over 100mbps (we had a school upgrade from 3x bonded ADSL to 3x bonded FTTC this week and get online speedtests, which we don’t even like, in excess of 160mbps.  And that’s still in the training period and without us performing any kind of benchmarking and optimisation of the connection).

We’re looking to push the technology to its limits and show to people that they don’t need to wait for Fibre on Demand to get BETTER download and upload throughput, with reliability and quality to beat it too.

Maybe it’s not fair for me to think bad of BT for not upgrading our capacity when the vast majority of businesses don’t have access to FTTC yet, but this isn’t a matter of priority, as they have already made it very clear how they deal with these things.

What this is is bad network management, once more, and basically breaking their own promises.  It does say Availability Date in that column, not Target Availability Date or Estimated, or anything like that.

Will it be 7th May? I doubt it.

Every Ethernet connection we supply to every customer is resilient across multiple tail circuits, and routed via the UKs only multiVNO access network, delivering platform level resilience – something no other UK ISP can match.

There is a perception in the market place that leased lines somehow offer a better SLA or “guarantees” when it comes to uptime or fault fixing. This isn’t the case. Leased lines still have faults &#8211; they still go down. And when they do, they take a business down with it.

The question any business owner or IT Manager needs to ask themselves is, if I suffer an extended period of downtime, will a small rebate make up for the hassle and lost revenue?

The new Evolving Networks SLA is market beating in terms of uptime and fix time guarantees but it doesn’t change our core proposition – make everything as resilient as possible, use all your bandwidth (why pay for a back up circuit that you don’t use) and ensure that failover is seamless and requires no change of IP address.

Nic Elliott, CTO comments; “whether they are built on ADSL, FTTC, leased lines, 4G or a combination of different tail circuits there is not a more resilient ethernet connection available in the marketplace and we felt it was time for our SLA to reflect that.”

We’ve been providing multi-line connectivity now for a decade, under the guise of “Bonded Internet Connectivity”.
  
Whether it’s Bonded ADSL, Bonded FTTC, Bonded FTTP, Bonded Leased Lines or a combination of different technologies, we’ve stuck with the term bonding to describe the service. But now that’s going to change.

Connectivity has moved on a lot in the last 10 years, and the term “bonding” no longer does justice to the much wider feature set our solutions provide.
  
As the only team of UK Software Engineers and Network Developers focused on designing and deploying our own software for UK infrastructure, we’ve taken the decision to reflect developments we’ve made with a change of product name.

Bonding is the foundation of our product, allowing us to establish a network virtualisation fabric across any connectivity. But to reflect the changing communication landscape, as technology like FTTP and G.fast becomes more prevalent, all our business and enterprise products will now be known as Multipath Ethernet.

Whether deployed as part of a wider SD-WAN connecting multiple sites together, or for a single business premises, Multipath Ethernet is our Agile, Intelligent, Resilient connectivity solution – Ethernet grade, multi-line, software-defined, tailored to your business.

## What is Multipath Ethernet?

  * Multi-line resilience – where MPLS has none
  * Aggregated bandwidth of all component links – not load balanced
  * Any combination of circuit technology – Broadband, Leased Line, 4G, FTTP, G.fast
  * Prioritised for YOUR cloud applications with Zero-Touch QoS
  * VoIP traffic protected, on every connection, not just leased lines
  * Delivered over our self-healing Multi-VNO SDN Platform
  * SLAs that beat leased lines
  * Constantly monitored by our AI and network engineers
  * Elimination of single points of failure

## It doesn’t stop here

Our software developers are still hard at work adding new features, whether its Layer 2, virtualised appliances or automatic fault diagnostics.
  
We’ll keep adding and refining, and trying to make connectivity in the UK the best that it can be, while keeping your business online through thick and thin.

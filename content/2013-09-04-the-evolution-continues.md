March of this year was an exciting time for Evolving Networks as we made the move to our new offices located in Lynch Wood business park, Peterborough.

Due to a rapid expansion over recent years, the need for larger premises became imperative.

Evolving Networks are constantly changing and developing to ensure we can provide the best possible connections and services for our customers. That’s why we offer all our customers a future proofed bonded internet connection so that as technologies develop, their connections can too.

We’re happy to say there will be some exciting new developments coming over the next few weeks, so keep an eye out for our future posts!

We would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our customers for making this evolution possible and for helping us to grow from strength to strength.

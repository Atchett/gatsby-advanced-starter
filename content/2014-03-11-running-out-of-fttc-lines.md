We’ve come across the first instance we’ve seen of a location that has had FTTC for some time (years), but that now has to wait for further capacity to get more!

Interestingly this is our own office Datum House.  We are installing more FTTC lines, not because we need the extra bandwidth, but because we want to do more testing.

I’m always interested in breaking some records, so it’s time to see how much bandwidth we can deliver, as well as making our office more flexible with testing new network configurations and deployments.

Because we have seamless failover on our bonded internet connection, we can unplug any circuits we like for testing and configuring new kit, without any interruption to every day work.  When done, an engineer will just plug it back in again and it will seamlessly add itself back to the bonded connection.

But when we checked the broadband availability checker on BT’s systems, we saw a message showing that further FTTC lines could not be provided until extra capacity had been added somewhere to the system.

Ironically, the very same day, we had had one of our regular sales/technical/marketing meetings reviewing products and services, focussing specifically on FTTC and its future.

One of the areas we discussed was our feeling that FTTC, like the other broadband technologies that have been deployed over the last 15 years, would follow a predictable pattern of investment, availability and reliability.

We love FTTC, but like all broadband (and indeed all internet connectivity technologies) it has its flaws and weaknesses.  What we do is improve internet connections, enhancing the good bits, and reducing the bad bits.

It was agreed that there may come a time when, despite how the FTTC network is currently running, and any predictions of cross talk affecting the service, the local capacity may degrade the service of the customers in an area.

For example, there may not be enough backhaul bandwidth to exchanges, or to individual cabinets, or the equipment at both cabinet and exchange may start experiencing too much load.

One consequence of high subscription levels is a need to physically add more line cards to the DSLAMs to cope with the additional lines, and that that could stop new deployments from going ahead if a cabinet is literally full.

Well that is what has happened.

We aren’t experiencing lower bandwidth than normal.  We aren’t detecting issues of stability

BT Openreach have seen that there isn’t enough capacity somewhere in the network locally for new FTTC connections, and in fact have not managed to add capacity soon enough for new orders.

We’re left with a date of April for new capacity, at which point we will check again to see if we can place an order for FTTC.  What’s nice to know if that our predictions for how this will work over time are coming accurate, which only helps when we have to advise customers on deployments and new sales.

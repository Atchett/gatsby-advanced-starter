The big technology companies have some interesting practices when it comes to supplying their software on different platforms.

Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft – they all want to make money, but they also want dominance, and they have some ideas on how to do it based on using or abusing their technology position.

Here’s what I am getting at.  Apple are the prime example really, in that they don’t supply their software (operating system in the main) on anything other than their own hardware.  Here is where we do have to make the distinction, because what Apple have done is produce iTunes for Windows, so we’ll come back to that later.

Microsoft have always historically had the view that they’ll make the software, and you can run it on whatever hardware you like.  Hence the PC industry was born.  But all that is changing, and the market share of smartphones and tablets is rocketing in relation to good old fashioned desktop PCs and laptops.

So you can get Windows, and you can install it on any bit of hardware that supports it.

With Apple, you can’t put iOS on anything – it comes with your iPhone and there it will stay.  If you want something that runs on iOS then you need an iPhone or an iPad, and there is nothing you can do about it.

The reason they do that, is that they want to convert you to use just their kit.  They want to hook you into an ecosystem that includes purchases of apps and services that keep you with them and make it more difficult to move to a different platform.

Google have a slightly different approach.  They do want you to use their software, and they have an ecosystem similar to Apple’s, but they give away their mobile operating system (Android) to hardware manufacturers, so you do get a choice of hardware.

Google want you to perform searches and click on ads, which is where their money making skills lie.  So providing a piece of software for free to get into the pockets of billions is a great way of putting their search function front and centre, and make a lot of money very quickly.

So Microsoft now want a piece of the action, and they have Windows Phone and they have started manufacturing their own hardware such as the Surface.

They have also bet heavily on Windows 8, and rightly so, as both a tablet and desktop operating system, and clearly worked hard on a touch interface that, while many desktop users won’t get it, it’s a good way of navigating on a tablet.

With Windows 8 came a new ecosystem of apps designed for the Modern UI (once called Metro).  The tile based full screen experience.

Now seeing as Windows is still the dominant desktop operating system, surely Google who make the Chrome web browser, would create a version for the new Modern UI.  But no.

Here is where the war is found.

You can bet the reason they haven’t provided a Modern version of Chrome is because they want Windows to fail.

They also have a long running dispute with Microsoft over Youtube on the Windows Phone platform.  Again, it’s all about the fight for market share in the mobile space.

iTunes came before all of this – when the iPhone and the iPad were merely a twinkle in Jonny Ive’s eye.  At the time, in order for the iPod to be the runaway success it was (even though it wasn’t the first mp3 player, or the best), iTunes had to be available on the OS that everyone had at home, Windows.

Apple didn’t try and force people to buy a Mac in order to use their iPod – it would have failed.  But nowadays, with the market changing, things aren’t that simple any more.

But where does it end, and is this competition good for the consumer?

I would argue that it isn’t much competition at all if I have to switch everything I have, hardware, software and service, over to one supplier, or supplier ecosystem.

So here is where it starts getting interesting.

Microsoft have always had a version of Office for the Apple Mac.  Well now they have a version for the iPad.

If ever there was an example of “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em”, it’s this.  They can’t kill the iPad, so why not produce software for it.

It was always touted as a consumer device, not a business machine, and that’s how Microsoft sold Windows and Office – “it’s the PC that’s a business machine, dummy!”

But now they have given a huge boost to Apple, by endorsing the iPad as a machine you can work on.  You can now create and edit those Word documents and Excel spreadsheets on an iOS device.

Mozilla have just cancelled their development of the Firefox browser for the Modern UI (Windows 8).  This is a blow to Microsoft because it would have endorsed their new tile based vision of their operating system.

Having said that, if people love the Windows 8 interface, then they will use the only major browser they can get for it – Internet Explorer, so Microsoft win.

If that happens, you can definitely expect Chrome and Firefox to produce rivals for it.  The fact that Office is now available on the iPad means Microsoft have worked out they can make more money by supporting the platform than by fighting it.

Why cut off a revenue stream when you can exploit it instead?

I haven’t mentioned Amazon.  They are an interesting player, and not to be underestimated.  They are investing heavily in hosting (what everyone stupidly calls The Cloud) these days.  They also dominate the e-reader market with the Kindle and have a compelling and popular tablet in the Kindle Fire.

They have recognised that if you want to buy a book from them, then you have to be able to read it everywhere, so they have a Kindle app for every major operating system for phone, tablet and computer.  They admit that they basically sell devices at a loss in order to make money on the subscription services of content.

I would doubt Amazon and Apple are going to get into internet search any time soon, but Google and Microsoft still slug it out.  They all want a slice of the mobile market though, and what they want is to get you hooked into as many of their services as they can, for a fee of course.

Regardless of what any of these companies say, none of them favour an “open” environment.  Some are more hypocritical than others – Apple probably the worst, for having the most proprietary systems and policies known to man, all under the guise of open standards.

But what have they successfully done with their mobile and tablet platforms?  Kill Adobe Flash.  No one wants it anymore, and it’s because Apple took a stand.

At the time I thought they were crazy.  Steve Jobs literally highlighted it on the first iPad demo, where he went to a popular newspaper website and there on the screen was a white square where a flash animation should have been.

But it worked, and lo and behold, our new website (coming very soon) has its flash animation removed.

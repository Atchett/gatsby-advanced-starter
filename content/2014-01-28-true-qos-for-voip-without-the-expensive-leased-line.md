I have recently been talking to a few customers who have been told by BT that their VoIP systems will only work with Fibre Ethernet ‘leased lines.’ These connections can cost thousands of pounds per month with large set up fees, long contract lengths and lengthy lead times. And for the amount of bandwidth the majority of users actually require for their VoIP systems, leased lines are somewhat of an overkill.

Customers are being told that bonded ADSL connections will not work with their new VoIP systems, because the bonded ADSL connection will not provide sufficient bandwidth, or low enough latency.  This is not the case, not with an Evolving Networks connection anyway.

VoIP calls themselves require very little bandwidth, needing only around 100kbps for each call. So even 50 concurrent calls would only require a 5mbps connection. Bandwidth is not the issue when it comes to crystal clear VoIP calling, and throwing more bandwidth at VoIP problems won’t make them better. Even on a 100mbps Fibre Ethernet connection if a user starts a large download, the traffic for the download will interfere with the VoIP traffic, resulting in poor quality VoIP calls.

The key to high quality VoIP calling is a high quality connection. The connection needs to have low latency, and allow the packets of voice data to get to the right place at the right time, and in the right order. The secret to this is Quality of Service or QoS for short.

Evolving Networks are the first and only Bonded ADSL provider to provide true QoS over a bonded connection. This means we can now ring fence individual packets of data, to ensure they are not interrupted by any other data used on the connection.  Meaning VoIP calls are protected from all other data, both upstream and downstream. Therefore an Evolving Networks connection is perfect for all of your office’s needs, and there is no need to take on the overheads required for a leased line.

BTs advice to customers that leased lines are required to use a VoIP system seems to be a very clever way to sell more of them. We currently have hundreds of customers using VoIP systems with our connections, with crystal clear results. So don’t worry if you currently have a VoIP system or are thinking about getting one, you don’t need to spend thousands of pounds on a Fibre Ethernet leased line.

For more information on how our connections can work with your VoIP system give one of our sales team a call on 0330 55 55 333.

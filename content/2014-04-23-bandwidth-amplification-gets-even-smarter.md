  Back in January we introduced our exclusive Bandwidth Amplification product as a way of making our connections even better. Initially this was achieved by compressing data files on the fly, and effectively generating bandwidth out of thin air.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  We have been working on this further and have now expanded Bandwidth Amplification into a whole suite of technologies. This includes new features that will improve the end users experience of our connections even further.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  <b>Transparent Multi-streaming</b> – Effectively building download manager technology within our connections making better use of your available bandwidth when downloading or uploading single streams of data. We will accelerate a single stream of data by running multiple sessions within our network, utilizing the available bandwidth you have.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  <b>TCP Optimisation</b> – Imagine a typical office environment, you have users all doing their own thing all connected to the same internet connection &#8211; Sending Emails, downloading updates, video conferencing, Hosted Desktop environment, the list goes on. This can give a feeling of the connection running slow when web browsing. What we can do is prioritise the web browsing aspects of a connection, such as DNS Lookups and TCP acknowledgements, to dramatically reduce retransmissions and packet loss so the end users browsing is snappy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  With the addition of these two features Bandwidth Amplification becomes even more of a powerful tool to improve the customer’s experience. Each businesses connection is unique and tailored, making it work for you!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  We have customers who previously struggled with their connection, now with these added features switched on their web browsing is seamless and things like daily backups to the cloud take half the time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  At the end of the day whatever connectivity you can get, we want to make it better. Gone are the days of throwing more bandwidth at a problem to fix it. Let’s make your connection smart!

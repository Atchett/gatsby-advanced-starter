Evolving Networks provide internet connections unlike any other. Evolving Networks upgrade each bonded connection as new technology is available, meaning your internet connection evolves as the communications landscape changes – **delivering the only internet connection a business will ever need.**

An Evolving Networks internet connection is a vital tool for enterprises seeking an edge in today’s increasingly competitive world. It provides **unlimited, resilient internet connectivity** from a single port, while allowing automatic, seamless adoption of newer communications technologies as they appear. Scalable to changing traffic needs, an Evolving Networks internet connection is **a uniquely future-proofed connectivity solution**; ensuring that enterprises always stay ahead with the best possible connectivity for their developing business needs.

An Evolving Networks internet connection is ideal for organisations that wish to upgrade to fibre connectivity, but do not know when &#8211; or even if &#8211; the rollout will reach them. With Evolving Networks, users can obtain the ADSL performance and resilience they require **immediately**, in the knowledge that their internet connection will upgrade to FTTC whenever it becomes available, **without cost, change of IP settings or interruption to service.**

Evolving Network’s <a title="Future Proof" href="/future-proof/" target="_blank">future proofing </a>is a natural benefit of their **‘We bond anything’ technology**. Every organisation has different Internet connectivity needs and priorities, which change over time. Evolving Networks meet these changing needs, whatever their nature, by bonding multiple circuits together to form a single, resilient connection.

Multiple FTTC links can be bonded for extra bandwidth and security, while many businesses also add “traditional” ADSL to the mix; keeping them online even if the entire FTTC infrastructure locally suffers an outage. Some companies particularly need increased upload performance for **cloud-based services** or large file transfers; this can be delivered by bonding an EFM link into their connection.

Evolving Networks’ bonded connectivity is enabled by their **fast and resilient UK-wide private network**. This is distributed across multiple data centres with diverse carrier failover and multiple provider endpoints. All connections offer **uncontended and unthrottled bandwidth**, passing through the network’s data centres direct to mirrored virtualised bonding clusters and then out to the internet.

**“**We don’t know which improved, faster technologies the future has in store, nor do we know what a customer’s future requirements will be**”** commented <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abbigail Knowles, Marketing Manager</span> **“**but it doesn&#8217;t matter, we simply **keep evolving our customers’ connectivity to accommodate every development as it appears**. Our thousands of users across the UK can benefit from each new improvement in performance, resilience and stability, they do so seamlessly and before their competitors do.**”**

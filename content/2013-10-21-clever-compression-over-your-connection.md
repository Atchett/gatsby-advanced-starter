Most people will have heard of compression or used it, often in the form of sending or receiving a large email attachment and the files are all squashed into one little zipped folder. In most cases, compression is all about using references rather than words or pixels to make files smaller and easier to move. But compression can be more important than that and can really improve your internet connection.

In many ways, compression is something that has to be justified. It can’t be done for free and we have no doubt that some people may not see a real reason to pay for it. But compression over a bonded connection with us is something to shout about.

So, what’s it all about?

Well compression does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s all about squeezing as much traffic through your connection as possible without affecting how it is delivered to you. The thing that makes this different with us, it’s all done through our own private network. The benefits? It only happens within our network. That means no competition, no fighting for bandwidth with other network providers.

By running compression over connections through our network, we are able to squeeze more traffic through. But it’s not just about getting as much traffic as we can through, there still has to be resiliency and prioritisation on that connection as well.

If you’ve been following our blog posts over recent weeks, you’ll also know we can do true [QoS][1] as well. This means that with compression we can squeeze as much traffic through as possible and it is still prioritised using [QoS][1], which then tries to avoid queuing and prevent traffic loss. Meaning that the right packets get to the right destination quickly even with reduced bandwidth.

All in all, we want our customers to have the best connection possible. We bond in a way that allows customers to benefit from resiliency, failover and have access to 24/7 support. Both QoS and Compression are valuable services we can now proudly offer our customers. Keep an eye out for more on this as we will be going into a lot more detail in future posts.

[Part 3][1] of our Chairman’s Broadband story was about the deployment process, in which we talked about getting the lines in place ready for our bonding equipment to arrive.

The next part of this process is actually configuring the equipment in our lab so that it is ready and simple for the customer to install and begin bonding!

Firstly, when the order is originally placed and sent across from our sales team, we make the decision of which one of our exclusive bonders to use for the connection. We do this by looking at the throughput estimations of the lines and from this, determine what capacity bonder they will need.

In the case of our Chairman’s broadband, we chose the EV3 (see picture) as this piece of equipment will be able to effectively handle the two FTTC lines with ease.

The next step is to configure the bonder with pre-set weightings based on the estimated throughput already mentioned. This allows the customer’s connection to go live as soon as possible and means that as soon as the equipment is plugged in, they are connected.

We then create a Quick Start Guide tailored to the customers’ requirements. This explains clearly how to set up the equipment once it reaches the customer, with all the relevant IP details so they can configure their firewall and any other devices on site.

Once the equipment has been sent and plugged in, the lines can go live. We’ll talk about our Chairman’s first line going live in Part 5!

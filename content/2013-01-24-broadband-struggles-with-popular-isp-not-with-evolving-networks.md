Slow internet is a common issue that many internet service providers (ISP) battle against. Contention on lines and network capacity issues are also problems that customers can face with some ISPs.

It was announced yesterday that Sky has confirmed that their customers may be experiencing slow speeds as a consequence of them signing up too many new subscribers.

Sky promotes that they provide “unlimited broadband” that has no usage cap. Customers expect to be able to use their service at all times, but yet again an ISP has fallen to contention and network capacity issues.

The contention on the lines means that customers are unable to download at speeds that are essential for the use of their connection. All that Sky has been able to do is work on increasing their capacity; how long it takes is dependent on how much extra network capacity is actually needed. A bit late as it should have been increased as new subscribers joined their network.

Sky may be growing, but so are we. Our rapid growth has meant that we, unlike Sky, have increased our network capacity as we welcome new customers to our bonded internet solutions. As a result, our customers’ service remains reliable and resilient. By doing this we are able to avoid exactly the issue that SKY has fallen into.

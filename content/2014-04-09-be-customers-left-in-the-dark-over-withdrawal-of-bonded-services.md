  In January, Evolving Networks reported that BE Broadband (taken over by Sky in 2013), had announced to customers that they were to withdraw their bonded services completely from the market commencing February 2014.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An influx of incoming sales enquiries has confirmed that many BE customers have been left with very little information and very little time to find an alternative supplier since the announcement.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It appears that many BE customers have been given rather misleading or no information at all from Sky as to when their bonded service will end. They have been given no accurate timescale and in some cases, have been given as short as 5 days notice prior to their cut-off date to find an alternative supplier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Mike Highfield, Bonded Connectivity Specialist at Evolving Networks said “The BE customers I have spoken to are clearly frustrated. There is a feeling that the information from SKY is not accurate or even non-existent.” The only information some BE customers have received is simply an estimated month for when the service will end &#8211; not even a specific date.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  “As little as 5 working days to find a new ISP that will deliver the same quality of service as BE for the same price has led to businesses making snap decisions based on cost alone. There is a positive response to the service that BE delivered, but clearly this was unsustainable at the prices they were charging and that is why Sky will no longer be supporting it” says Mike.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As their bonded services are withdrawn from exchanges, BE customers are actively seeking out other bonded suppliers. Evolving Networks express that is important to consider that for the same or higher quality of connectivity that they received with BE, they will inevitably have to pay more.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Evolving Networks are specialist providers of bonded solutions and can bond any tail technology from any UK carrier. BE were only able to provide bonded solutions in a subset of exchanges, Evolving Networks can provide to any location in the UK.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Customers moving from other suppliers will experience a seamless migration to the Evolving Networks private network supported by a dedicated Account Manager &#8211; keeping businesses connected through reduced downtime.

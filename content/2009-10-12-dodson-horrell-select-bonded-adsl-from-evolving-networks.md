Evolving Networks, the UK’s most innovative provider of mission critical bonded ADSL solutions, is pleased to welcome Dodson & Horrell to their customer list.

As bonded ADSL provider of choice to the defence industry, the flexibility and visibility afforded by Evolving Networks’ solutions is becoming increasingly appreciated by demanding commercial organisations in other sectors as well.

Gerry White, Business Development Director of Evolving Networks said “the transparency and situational awareness delivered as standard with a bonded ADSL solution from Evolving Networks is what has established us as the leading provider of bonded ADSL to the defence sector, and other high profile organisations that depend on their internet connectivity, such as the Health Protection Agency. These qualities are no less valid for any other company, and our technology provides a welcome improvement to the mass market bonded ADSL offerings out there.”

Dodson & Horrell are Europe’s leading horse feed manufacturer, a brand that is synonymous with high quality feeds and possess a coveted Warrant to supply the Royal Household. This commitment to quality, as well as a global distribution network to manage, meant that the selection of a bonded ADSL supplier was a critical decision.

Having spoken to Evolving Networks, and seen a live demonstration of the cutting edge technology that separates them from the mass market bonded ADSL offerings, the choice became clear.

On Tuesday George Osborne, the Chancellor of the coalition UK government, confirmed that in his 2011 Autumn Statement that their £30bn National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) will commit an additional £100m to help enforce the current nationwide rollout of superfast broadband services in up to ten cities across the UK.

At the moment the governments Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) office already has £530m set aside to be used until 2015 to help 90% of people in principally rural areas gain access to superfast broadband (24mbps+) ISP services (the last 10% will receive at least 2mbps).

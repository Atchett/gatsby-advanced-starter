So our Chairman has received his shiny new kit from Evolving Networks. The only thing left to do is to plug it all in and configure his firewall, before taking his brand new connection for a first spin. This post is all about going live on the first line.

We always make sure that the deployment of the connection is fully planned, ensuring that the new equipment arrives on site at least one day before the first line goes live. We do this so that the process of installing the equipment is as stress free and as straight forward as possible. This also means that you can begin using the new connection from the very moment the service first connects.

Along with our kit we send out a helpful Quickstart guide, containing all of the information needed to get the first line up and running. The guide includes a useful diagram of how the equipment should be connected, as well as the relevant settings that will be needed for the customers firewall.

Once it’s plugged in and set up it’s ready to go! The only thing left to do is to wait for the service to go live…

Experience tells us that DSL services can go live at any time during the day. This varies for each and every connection and literally means you could be waiting until midnight before obtaining any form of connectivity. There is no need to be alarmed if this seems to be taking longer, it is perfectly normal behaviour and is completely in the hands of BT.

However in the case of our Chairman, he needed FTTC installing which means a site visit is required from an Openreach engineer who is responsible for installing and testing an Openreach branded FTTC modem. Providing there are no underlying faults on the circuit, the service will go live as soon as the engineer completes the installation.

Fortunately this was the case for our Chairman, so once the engineer had installed the modem his connection was then live and visible to us on eView Live.

Once the first line is up and running we will begin the 10 day training period. We’ll talk about this more in Part 6!

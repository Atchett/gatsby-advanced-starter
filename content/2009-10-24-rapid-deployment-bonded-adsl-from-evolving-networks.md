Evolving Networks are pleased to launch another innovation in their suite of managed bonded ADSL products, rapid deployment.

We recognise that there are times when connectivity needs to be installed fast, where every day delayed is a day of lost profits.  Increasingly, Evolving Networks have been deploying bonded ADSL solutions for businesses let down by mass market and “me too” bonded ADSL offerings. 

If you have agreed to a bonded ADSL solution that now cannot be delivered, or if you are looking to switch to an industrial strength bonded ADSL link, Evolving Networks can now have you up and running in 24 hours.

Gerry White, Business Development Director at Evolving Networks – “Suppliers have been able to fast track the provision of ADSL lines for some time, but there is a difference between simply a fast tracked ADSL line, and the next day delivery of a truly bonded ADSL solution.  We have the capacity to deliver preconfigured bonded ADSL kit to a customer location the next business day, adding another level of flexibility to our already leading edge bonded ADSL offerings.

“It may be a lease agreement falling through at the last minute, an existing supplier terminating their agreement for whatever reason, or any number of other factors that leave you let down and in need of high speed internet capacity at short notice.  Regardless of the reason, Evolving Networks are deploying an increasing number of bonded ADSL solutions at very short notice.  Our message is clear, whatever the reason, if you need high speed internet connectivity and you need it quickly, Evolving Networks are able to help.  No one can deliver bonded ADSL quicker.”

The ability to deliver bonded ADSL in 24 hours is obviously dependent upon  some external factors, but for the vast majority of businesses in the UK who have either a MAC code from their existing ADSL supplier, or a PSTN line currently in place, they can indeed be up and running with a fully bonded ADSL solution within 24 hours.

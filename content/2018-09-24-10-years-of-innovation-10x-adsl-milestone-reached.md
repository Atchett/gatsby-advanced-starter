## What’s better than a high speed circuit delivering your internet connection? The answer is multiple high speed circuits – especially if it’s a Multipath Ethernet connection through our Multi-VNO access network.

But where would you stop? Two lines? Three? Five?

Well how about 10?

For years now, we have deployed 8 line and occasionally 9 line Multipath Ethernet connections over ADSL and FTTC in the UK. But we never had a 10-line solution. Until now.

This week we went live with our first ever 10 circuit Multipath Ethernet over ADSL connection – fitting as we celebrate 10 years of technology development.

Installed in Scotland and delivering in excess of 120mbps download and 15mbps upload, this single, logical, aggregated connection is delivering resilience and scale for a business that needs high bandwidth and serious uptime guarantees.

This is testament to our entire team. From the home-grown network engineers and software developers who pioneered the software in the UK, to the service delivery co-ordinators and project managers who arranged this complex install, we have all shown we can deliver exceptional Software enhanced connectivity solutions where no one else can.

As we mark 10 years of UK technology success, our vision is fixed on continuing to innovate.

No other UK technology company has the pedigree or focus to deliver the new and exciting connectivity developments that businesses need as we head to 2020 and beyond.

We’ve the breached 100mbps and 1Gbps thresholds. We’ve delivered both Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity with SD-WAN. We have aggregated every fixed line technology available, including FTTP and Leased Lines. Now we have smashed the 10-line barrier.

What’s next? We’ll let you know when we’ve cracked it.

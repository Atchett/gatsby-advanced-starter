We’ve not made a big shout about breaching the 100mbit per second barrier.

Ever since our latest generation of hardware hit customers’ sites, we’ve had gigabit capable ports on the devices, and the processing power needed to shift high bandwidths.

But in practice, not many people need more than 100mbit connections, and its difficult to get those speeds with ADSL lines alone.

Enter FTTC.

The advanced processing capabilities of our latest bonded internet gateways mean we can easily strap 2 or more FTTC circuits together and aggregate their bandwidth.

Not all FTTC lines are high bandwidth, but for those in the 50+mbit region we can breach that 100mbit barrier and shoot for even higher.

To our knowledge we are the only ISP offering real throughputs in the multiple hundreds of megabits per second with bonded FTTC.

Many companies have claimed to launch a bonded FTTC service and then predictably made wild assertions on the theoretical maximum combined line rates of say 4x bonded FTTC.

This is where we sigh at the unrealistic expectations companies set.

We don’t do that.

The higher the bandwidth of the circuits, the more ridiculous and inaccurate these “up to” figures become, especially when adding them all together (compounding the error).

But also, these ISPs aren’t actually providing the high end connections. Why?

Because they can’t.

We don’t like to name names, but we have provided 4x bonded FTTC connections to customers where those other ISPs (although they advertise selling a 4x bonded FTTC service) were unwilling to actually provide it.

That’s great, as it only leaves us, and buying a bonded FTTC connection from us will deliver the increased bandwidth you need, and can give you throughputs greater than 100mbit and 200mbit if the underlying circuits are big enough.

Of course this opens up the issues of whether your local area network and firewall can cope with 100mbit+, but that’s another matter for another post.

We’ve also just had our 4<sup>th</sup> FTTC line installed in our head office, so we can showcase bonded FTTC and 200mbit+ connectivity – we’ll talk more about that soon as well…

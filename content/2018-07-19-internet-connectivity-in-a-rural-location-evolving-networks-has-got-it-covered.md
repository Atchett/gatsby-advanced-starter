Head quartered in Sussex, Bleach of Lavant are an established, family operated, logistics and haulage business with a proud history.

When the need arose to upgrade a key piece of business software, they were hit with a familiar problem: the job management software they wanted to buy requires a high capacity, low contention, connection to the internet.

Head quartered as they are in a rural location, ADSL is low capacity, and a leased line prohibitively expensive.

Evolving Networks provided a solution to this critical business problem, supplying a multipath ethernet solution based on multiple ADSL circuits at head office, delivering capacity via our multiVNO private network that was uncontended, low latency and unlimited, thereby allowing Bleach of Lavant to make their software upgrade without the need for expensive leased lines.

However, the business benefits didn’t end there. In addition to their ADSL circuit for primary business use, Bleach also operate a second site in Arundel, and maintained a VPN between the two sites, with an additional ADSL at head office.

In order to deliver as much capacity as possible, the VPN ADSL service was absorbed into the multipath ethernet circuit delivered at this location, and Evolving Networks SD-WAN software delivered a layer 2 LAN extension to the Arundel site, removing the need for the cumbersome VPN entirely.

The result is a high capacity, resilient, low latency internet connection at head office, allowing access to key cloud based software, as well as a much improved site to site link that brings the Arundel workers onto the head office LAN and removes a significant IT management problem, by dispensing with the VPN entirely.

Nic Elliott, CTO of Evolving Networks comments, “we’ve spent 10 years developing both the network virtualisation software and high performance network to deliver on what people are now calling SD-WAN. We’ve been here for years and its important UK businesses understand that this technology is for everyone, we’re as happy rolling out a two site solution that helps an SME as we are linking together 100 sites for a large corporate. SD-WAN is not something that is only available to the big boys”.

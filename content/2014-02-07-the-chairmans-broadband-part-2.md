Following on from our first post about The Chairman’s Broadband, Part 2 is all about placing the order for the first line.

I was given the task of ordering and deploying the Chairman’s broadband. After hearing the history of his connection, I was surprised that this hadn’t happened earlier given the issues that he had encountered with his other supplier.

The first thing we normally do is check any current lines onsite, just so we know what it is we are working with and how we can expect the finished connection to perform. So, as normal, I did a BT check on the current PSTN onsite and as you can see from the image that the FTTC estimated ranges vary quite heavily.

The ‘Downstream Line Rate (Mbps)’ differs by as much as 9.4mbps. At that time, we were unsure what to expect as we have four figures, all with no consistency. Will having a completely fresh PSTN installed give us better speeds? Will it give us the ‘Clean’ Range as it is a new line? Only once the line has been installed we will find out…

(We’ve discussed the inconsistency of speeds using the FTTC Range A and Range B checker in more detail in a previous blog post as well, to read it click [here][1].)

Whilst ordering the PSTN, we did face a small issue in that there were no spare pairs available to the location. Sometimes this can cause delays of up to 5 working days, but in this case the problem was resolved within 1 working day which was excellent news.

With the PSTN ordered, we proceeded with the Simultaneous Provide order for the FTTC on this line.

When the FTTC SIM Provides first came about, it meant that you could place the order for the FTTC before the PSTN was live &#8211; and that the FTTC engineer wouldn’t come out to site until a couple of days after the PSTN was installed. Now the engineers that go out to install the PSTNs have been able to complete the FTTC circuits as well, so we have a true FTTC SIM Provide!

Once we have the confirmation that the SIM Provide has succeeded, we are then able to schedule the configuration of the equipment. We’ll talk about this in Part 3…

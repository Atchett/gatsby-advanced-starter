Evolving Networks is pleased to announce an agreement to install a bonded broadband solution into HMS Belfast.

Moored on the Thames and one of London’s premier tourist attractions, HMS Belfast also provides an unusual challenge for connectivity providers to serve the communications needs of the staff working on board.

Although in the centre of London the unique positioning of HMS Belfast means that traditional leased line providers have not been able to provide a service due to a lack of local ducting infrastructure.

As Evolving Networks provide secure, private broadband connections delivered over copper but routed through a private network, our bonded broadband solutions – in this case truly bonded SDSL and ADSL links creating single redundant connection – are providing the solution.

By providing a bonded broadband service with a blend of ADSL and SDSL technologies, Evolving Networks are meetings both the download and upload requirements of HMS Belfast, and providing a bonded internet link with resilience built in to every level.

Evolving Networks have proven their bonded broadband capabilities through the successful installation of a bonded ADSL solution for the Imperial War Museum’s Nitrate Film Store at Duxford.  The Imperial War Museum (custodians & managers of HMS Belfast) have been using the existing bonded ADSL link at Duxford for the live streaming of on-site security camera data over a VPN.

The successful installation and long-term running of the Duxford bonded ADSL link was a prime driver behind the decision to install a bonded broadband solution at HMS Belfast, and Evolving Networks look forward to a continuing close relationship with the Imperial War Museum.

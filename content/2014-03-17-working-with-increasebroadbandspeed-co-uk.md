Since Christmas we have been working with Mark Heath at increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk after coming across his website and seeing that we shared a desire to improve internet connectivity.

Mark is in a great situation at the moment, where he can test a bonded internet connection comprising of 2x ADSL lines, and then as the fibre rollout in his area completes, can then test an ADSL/FTTC combination and then a 2x bonded FTTC itself.

As said in his first blog post <a href="http://www.increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk/2014/adsl-bonding-trial-evolving-networks" target="_blank">here</a>, he’s unfortunately been unlucky with one of the lines having faults on it, but we have been working together to ascertain exactly what the cause is, so we can get back to testing things properly.

The plan is to test aspects of the bonding itself, including line failure and recovery time, maximising throughput and so on. Then on to testing our new features such as packet prioritisation (QoS) and Bandwidth Amplification (compression and other bandwidth enhancing technologies).

There are loads of things to test, and you’ll be seeing fresh blog posts and articles at increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk as we go through the testing process.

Mark has an excellent understanding of how internet connections work, and the technologies that can really make a difference.  As we’ve said here before, it’s not all about bandwidth.  What we hope to learn through this process is how to make our connections and our service even better, by gaining a unique insight into how our connections are perceived.

With our recent advances in bonding high bandwidth circuits like 80/20 FTTC, and QoS and Bandwidth Amplification, we’re very excited in seeing how far we can push the technology, and tailor connections for businesses of all sizes.

Keep an eye on increasebroadbandspeed.co.uk and this blog for further developments.  Having independent testing of our new technology is an important phase for us in winning over more and more customers to the concept of bonding, and making internet connections better.

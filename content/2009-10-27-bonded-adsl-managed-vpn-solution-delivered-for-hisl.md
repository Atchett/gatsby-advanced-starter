When Helmet Integrated Systems Limited (HISL) decided to replace their IP Clear data link between their head office in Letchworth and manufacturing plant in Stranraer with a bonded ADSL VPN, it was a decision that they took very seriously.

As with most business users, the data link forms a critical communication linkage that enables the business units on each site to function in harmony. The BT IP Clear legacy solution had been in place for a number of years and was increasingly looking very expensive.

Having researched the market, a meeting with Evolving Networks was arranged to discuss their bonded ADSL and managed VPN solutions. After detailed discussion as to the needs and specific locations of both sites, a bespoke bonded ADSL managed VPN solution was proposed by Evolving Networks.

After conducting a thorough evaluation of both the technological options and the various available commercial partners, Evolving Networks were selected as the supplier of choice for the solution, with a triple bonded ADSL solution installed at each location.

Each bonded ADSL solution is delivered as a private connection into the Evolving Networks cloud, with point to point connectivity established via a fully managed Cisco device on each site. This set up delivers very robust, resilient and fast site to site connectivity by virtue of all site to site data being routed via the private network, rather than the public internet.

Double layer security is delivered through VPN encryption of all point to point data via the private network, with the VPN tunnels making use of all available data through the bonded ADSL links at each site. High speed resilient internet connectivity is delivered by utilising the massive download capability of the triple bonded ADSL links at each site, with internet connectivity routed through the network direct to each site, therefore not compromising the point to point data link.

Having replaced the IP Clear solution with bonded ADSL and a fully managed VPN, HISL are now taking advantage of both higher speed internet and point to point connectivity, increased resilience and a substantially reduced communications spend.

Evolving Networks specialise in fully managed point to point and internet connectivity solutions, delivered via bonded ADSL, to both improve business connectivity and to lower the communications spend of our customers.

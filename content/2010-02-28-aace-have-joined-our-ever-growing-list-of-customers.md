Evolving Networks are pleased to announce a new bonded ADSL customer with Aerospace Airworthiness Consultancy Enterprises Ltd (AACE) joining the ever growing list of Evolving Networks’ clients.

AACE was formed in 1996 in order to provide the UK Ministry of Defence with specialist airworthiness support, in a period where safety management were rapidly changing. Through the new partnership with AACE, Evolving Networks are cementing their position as the number one bonded ADSL provider to the defence industry.

Previously struggling on a single ADSL line, AACE needed a solution to the slow and unstable internet service they were receiving. Additionally, AACE needed higher upload capacity, which would help them support remote users accessing their networks via a VPN.

Evolving Networks have delivered an industrial strength bonded ADSL solution, delivering AACE a much faster connection and more reliable connection than a single ADSL line. 

Evolving Networks has rapidly become the UK’s market leading supplier of industrial strength bonded ADSL to business users throughout the UK, delivering high capacity, resilient connectivity solutions with outstanding technical support.

A key deciding factor for AACE was eView Live, the advanced network analytics platform provided only by Evolving Networks. 

EView Live ensures that all bonded ADSL connections are constantly monitored to ensure maximum stability and high speeds. Evolving Networks’ eView Live also identifies and fixes any problems automatically, while providing our UK based engineers with real time statistics and graphs. 

The visibility delivered via eView Live was an important deciding factor for AACE as it allows them to ensure that their bonded link is always scaled appropriately to meet their needs.

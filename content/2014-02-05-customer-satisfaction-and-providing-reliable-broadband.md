Recently Ofcom published its annual Consumer Experience Report and it revealed some quite interesting information on consumer’s satisfaction with their broadband providers.

Satisfaction has fallen quite considerably over the past year and the main reasons reported are:

  1. Speed of connection.
  2. Disruption of service.
  3. Poor Quality of connection.

(To read the story via ISP Review, <a href="http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2014/01/ofcom-find-decline-uk-satisfaction-reliability-broadband.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.)

With the term “superfast” broadband being the buzzword of the moment and without customers fully understanding how their connection works, I can entirely understand these figures.

Here at Evolving Networks, a stable, reliable and fast connection is what we provide. The unique way that we provide our services enables us to deliver that quality of service that a business needs!

As well as delivering a fast, disruption free, quality internet connection &#8211; we go that one step further to enhance your experience. As standard, we also apply prioritisation technologies over our bonded lines. This is what we call true Quality of Service (QoS). This ensures critical data such as VoIP, VPN and Remote Desktop services are not interrupted, regardless of what is happening on your LAN.

We can also apply Bandwidth Amplification to our connections, effectively giving you an even faster connection by enhancing what each line is capable of delivering. This is done by compressing data on the fly over the bonded link though our unique Private Network.

Increased speeds, resilience and quality is simply part of our service.

For more information on how we can deliver you a fast, reliable and quality connection give one of our sales team a call on 0330 55 55 333.

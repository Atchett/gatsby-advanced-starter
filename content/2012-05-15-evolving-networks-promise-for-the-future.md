At Evolving Networks we are dedicated to delivering the fastest possible connectivity to our customers, making use of the latest technology available. We know how important your internet connection is to your business and how a slow connection can set your business back. 

We have always been at the forefront of technological development in the UK. The latest evolution is Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC), and we are upgrading our customers bonded ADSL connections to take advantage of fibre ADSL wherever possible.

With BT currently in the middle of their nationwide FTTC roll-out, we are unfortunately not able to provide every customer with an FTTC upgrade. But with our future-proof promise, we look forward to bringing the latest developments in superfast broadband to all of our customers as soon as we can.

As the UK market leaders in the provision of industrial strength bonded ADSL solutions it is important to us to embrace new technologies as soon as they become viable. This means delivering fibre ADSL to customer as soon as it is available.

So, should fibre become available during the term of your bonded ADSL agreement we will raise this to you and with your permission set about upgrading your connection as quickly as we can. Our UK based engineers will closely monitor the upgrading of the connection and will thoroughly test your improved connection to ensure maximum approval. 

It’s not just bonded Infinity or FTTC lines, Evolving Networks can deliver a resilient, bonded internet connection to any business in the UK, by making use of whatever connectivity is available locally.
  
Should your needs change our bonded experts are able to bond multiple technologies together. For example if you’re connection is currently bonded EFM then we can bond that with a leased line. At Evolving Networks, we are always on the forefront of internet bonding and we can bond FTTC, EFM, Ethernet, ADSL and leased lines together. 

So if you do find that needs have changed or that you are interested in an upgrade, you can trust Evolving Networks to handle your connection. This is because at Evolving Networks we are passionate about both our customers and superfast broadband, and most importantly we don’t charge our customers a penny for the upgrade or changeover.

If you are a customer and want to find out more about when your business can receive an upgrade or you are interested in a bonded internet connection provided by Evolving Networks, please call our incredible support team on 0330 55 55 333 or [contact us][1] for more information.

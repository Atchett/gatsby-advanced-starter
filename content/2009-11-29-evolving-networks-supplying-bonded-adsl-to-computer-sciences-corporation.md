Evolving Networks, the leading supplier of industrial strength bonded ADSL solutions to the defence industry, is pleased to announce that they are a bonded ADSL supplier to CSC.

As a long standing supplier to the defence industry, Evolving Networks have been supplying a bonded ADSL &SDSL connection to BVT Surface Fleet (now BAE Systems) since early 2008.  Since winning an IT Systems support contract with BVT Surface Fleet several months ago, CSC have been able to work with Evolving Networks over a prolonged period of time.

Having worked closely with Evolving Networks, and witnessed the level of performance BVT Surface Fleet enjoy with their bonded ADSL & SDSL solution, CSC approached Evolving Networks regarding other customers with the need for high capacity, reliable internet connectivity.

In addition to delivering for their customers the exceptional level of performance enjoyed by BVT Surface Fleet, CSC will make use of the market leading eView Live application.  Unique to Evolving Networks, and developed in house, eView Live is a browser based application delivering full visibility as to the status and performance of each bonded ADSL solution.  As a service provider delivering first line support to the end user, CSC will reap tremendous value from the ability to manage all aspects of the bonded ADSL solution through the eView Live portal.

After an extensive period of discussions, Evolving Networks are now the sole bonded ADSL provider to CSC, and are now rolling out the first bonded ADSL solutions of the new partnership.

Evolving Networks are proud to be supplying bonded ADSL solutions to more high profile organisations through a partnership with one of the most respected names in the IT Services arena, and look forward to developing the relationship through the provision of many more bonded ADSL solutions.

If your business needs high quality, industrial grade bonded ADSL solutions, either for your own needs or to supply to your customers, Evolving Networks are the only choice.

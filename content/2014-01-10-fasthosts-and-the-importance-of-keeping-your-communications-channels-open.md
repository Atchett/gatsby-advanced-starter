I don’t mind saying that we have some servers with Fasthosts.  Nothing in their datacentre runs any of the actual bonding of customer connections, but there’s more to running a Bonded Internet Service Provider than that!

We host a number of systems in providers outside of our own network.  We do it for the kind of resilience is offers, and to make sure we aren’t caught out like Fasthosts were on Saturday.

In actual fact, we suffered no loss of service to the elements we host with Fasthosts at the weekend.  Why?  Because each and every application, file and monitoring system hosted with them, was also hosted somewhere else.

It’s the classic approach of mirroring services across multiple devices, and in this case multiple providers.

Here’s the real issue though – the way that Fasthosts handled it.

Not only were their customers’ websites, email, servers down, but so too were their own website, their support portal and they couldn’t update their service status page.  Add to that a virtually non-existent social media presence (one vague tweet), and you get the picture that they weren’t ready for this at all.

They actually hosted everything important to them, and provided their own internet connection, themselves.

So on the phone, the message was “we can’t even get online ourselves to update our service status page” and “we’re trying to find an employee with internet access at home so they can tweet”.

The best one was “you probably know more than we do as to what’s up and what’s down”.  That was truly shocking.

We’ve seen it before with other ISPs that suddenly drop off the face of the earth for a few hours and they don’t seem to learn from their mistakes!  Don’t use your own services for everything in case they fail!  When your customers need you the most, they won’t be able to get in touch with you and that will make them scared.

From the moment Evolving Networks was conceived, we made sure that whether it was email, website, phone lines, file storage, CRM or Accounts systems, everything was outside our network and hosted and provided by a multitude of different suppliers.

You can’t serve your customers if you can’t communicate with them, and whether its our website, or getting through to people on the phone, or email, you’ll never find a service related problem affect our ability to talk to our customers.

It’s not rocket science, but even big companies like Fasthosts get caught out.

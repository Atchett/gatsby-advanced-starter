Evolving Networks have successfully installed a bonded ADSL solution into the offices of Arthaus, one of the UKs leading visual communications consultancies.

As the UK’s most innovative supplier of bonded ADSL solutions, Evolving Networks are well versed in putting bonded ADSL into demanding situations.  And as a business founded on the quality of design concepts, the ability to communicate quickly and reliably with their customers is of paramount importance to Arthaus.

Having conducted market research Evolving Networks was selected as supplier of their bonded ADSL solution, with flexible pricing plans and market leading technology deciding factors.

The bonded ADSL solution was installed on time and on budget, and Evolving Networks UK based support staff was on hand to assist with the integration of the bonded ADSL link into existing LAN infrastructure.

As a growing business, operating in an arena where files are getting larger and sharing them is becoming ever more critical, Arthaus know that they can monitor their usage and network performance, and that their bonded ADSL link can be scaled up to meet their ongoing needs.

All of the above factors demonstrate why Arthaus is the latest business to join the ever growing list of companies working with Evolving Networks to enjoy the benefits of bonded ADSL.

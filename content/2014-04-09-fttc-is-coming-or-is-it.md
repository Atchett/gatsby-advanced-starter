On a daily basis I hear from customers that they have been told that FTTC is going to be available to them very soon.

Coming soon can mean a lot of things when it comes to the topic of fibre. It could mean that the exchange is being upgraded, or it could mean your cabinet is being upgraded. But both of these things don’t necessarily mean it’s available soon at all!

For the lucky few who are told FTTC is coming, they are also told an expected date for when fibre will be available…but this still doesn’t mean it’s definitely coming. These dates are estimates and are liable to change without warning. Dates can often change by a year on the date that FTTC was supposed to become available.

Recently I went onto the BT checker to see if fibre was available for a customer who had an expected FTTC date of the 31<sup>st</sup> March 2014. On the 27<sup>th</sup>, the checker was still saying that we would be able to place orders to upgrade the customer to FTTC on 31<sup>st</sup>. Then when I checked on the 31<sup>st</sup> March the date had jumped to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2014! By the way that this date jumped 9 months in 3 days shows that FTTC was never going to be available on that date in the first place.

There was no explanation from Openreach as to why this date had changed, only a message that read ‘Sorry it&#8217;s taking us longer than planned to get your cabinet ready for service. Please bear with us.’ So at least they do apologise.

I think the moral of the story here is that we shouldn’t rely on the dates to make decisions about connectivity. In theory these dates should allow customers to plan for FTTC upgrades, but in practise all they really mean is FTTC is coming…at some point.

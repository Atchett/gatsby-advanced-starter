As the UK’s Golden Summer of Sport comes to an end, Evolving Networks are pleased to report that [no customers reported a slow down][1] in their internet throughput for the duration of either the Olympic or Paralympic Games.

Whilst it is clear that the anticipated meltdown of the UK internet backbone failed to materialise, many ISPs have had difficulties due to the spike in IP traffic that occurred as a result of the unparalleled broadcasting and live streaming of all sports. As a provider of business class bonded internet solutions, Evolving Networks pride ourselves on the quality of our UK wide private network.

It is the combination of a carrier diverse, private network coupled with a very powerful central bonding infrastructure, based on high availability geographical diverse clustered servers that gives Evolving Networks the technical edge over our competitors.

All our bonded ADSL, and bonded ADSL / EFM & Ethernet solutions are delivered to end user customers as resilient, uncontended and unlimited services – so the quality of our network is of paramount importance. Evolving Networks invested significantly in upgrading our network well in advance of the Olympics and the results are clear. Increased network traffic, far higher than usual IP transit, and no speed complaints.

Whilst Evolving Networks don’t condone the watching of iPlayer at work, our network supports real time video on demand traffic over bonded ADSL, and we’re pleased that our customers were able to enjoy the Olympics and continue to perform their standard business operations.

If your business would benefit from robust, resilient and high capacity bonded internet connectivity get in touch with Evolving Networks today, or call 0330 55 55 333 to speak to the bonded ADSL experts.

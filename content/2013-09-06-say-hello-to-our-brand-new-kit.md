We have been very excited for the arrival of our brand new equipment which has travelled overseas to be with us! Well the time has come and we are pleased to show off the latest additions to the Evolving Networks team.

Not only are our new bonders better looking, they can also do some very clever things which our in-house experts have been working to perfect for a number of years.

Quality of Service (QoS) is something that ISP’s have struggled to crack. But here at Evolving Networks, we are happy to say we can do it! Our new bonders have the ability to seamlessly add QoS to a customer’s connection to provide them with the ability to prioritise traffic that will mean their business needs are always taken care of before anything else. QoS allows customers to use VoIP and other time sensitive traffic over the same internet connection as everything else without a loss in quality. Doing this means all available bandwidth can be used efficiently, with full failover, to protect the important traffic required by the business.

We know full well that the communications landscape is always developing, so we do our absolute best to always evolve with it. Our new kit is just an example of that and we want our customers to know that it’s all for them and the quality of their connections.

If you want to learn more about our new equipment, please feel free to get in touch by leaving your comments below.

We are happy to say that we will be talking about more exciting new features over the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for our future posts.

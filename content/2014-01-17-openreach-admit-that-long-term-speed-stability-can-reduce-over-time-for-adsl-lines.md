Openreach like the rest of BT, produce a lot of documents and a lot of… well “stuff”.

As an ISP we have to read through a lot of it, and try and interpret what it means so we can translate important information into something easy to understand and manage.

It’s really important from both a sales and support perspective that we do understand it, and that we communicate it right to our customers and potential customers.

What I’ve just found is actually a startling admission from Openreach.  The document in question is entitled “Superfast Fibre Access for Business”.  It’s a PDF factsheet talking about the FTTC/P commercial rollout and what it means for businesses.

There is a table at the top of the second page (it’s only a 2 page document) that compares what they are titling “Standard Broadband” with “GEA FTTC”.

Now forget for a minute the nuance between GEA and normal FTTC as that doesn’t have any bearing on the next bit.

What it says under Standard Broadband for “Long-term speed stability” is “Can reduce over time”.

What? Is this saying that ADSL and ADSL Max and ADSL 2+ (it must cover all three as the speed says up to 20Mbit/s) can just slow down over time and that that’s just tough?

I’m not sure what else can be inferred other than if it slows down (which it can if there is a genuine fault) then it’s NOT a fault, it’s just inherent to the technology.

I find this staggering.  I also don’t know where they get the figure of up to 3Mbit/s upload?  What version of DSL broadband is that I wonder?

What’s even more woolly is the statement it’s comparing to for FTTC.

“DLM (Dynamic Line Management) ensures best performance the line will support”.  Now that appears to me to mean that if Openreach deem that a line can’t support the faster speeds it once did, then again, it’s not a fault.

I’m all for ensuring stability but I’m also for ensuring the fastest possible speed in concert with that.  If a line performs well for months or years and then DLM decides that significantly slower is better that’s because there is a fault somewhere.

These two statements seem to mean that Openreach can wash their hands of any fault other than “the line is down”.

It’s complicated enough trying to be fair to customers and setting expectations of speeds as it is, without statements like this.

Consumers and businesses alike have seen the corruption of words and terms such as:

  * Unlimited
  * Traffic Management
  * Up to
  * Ensure
  * Best Efforts
  * Packet Shaping

None of these terms mean what they should any more, so it’s no wonder that consumer groups complain to OFCOM and the ASA.

Our approach is always to try and cut through this mess and offer real explanations for how things work, and to manage our network in the best way possible for our customers.

Lines slow down because of faults.  We keep an eye on every line we provide for potential changes in speed, and fix faults as soon as we see evidence of changes.

That’s how to provide good broadband internet connections.

If the trend of Openreach is going to be to fall back on statements like this, then we will fight them all the way and on behalf of all of our customers.

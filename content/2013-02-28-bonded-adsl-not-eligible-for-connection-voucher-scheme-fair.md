So the Connection Voucher Scheme set about by the Government is all about providing SME’s with monetary support to get access to the connectivity they need for their business.

While we think the scheme is a fantastic idea and could really help out some smaller businesses, we’re quite confused as to why bonded ADSL isn’t considered an eligible technology.

This has been causing us a bit of a headache for a fair few weeks now.

We understand that ADSL isn’t an NGA technology and completely get that the point of the scheme is to provide businesses with newer, faster connectivity options. But what about those businesses that can’t get Fibre, for example, at their exchange?

For some, bonded ADSL is the perfect solution. We recently had to let a potential customer down because we were told bonded ADSL wasn’t eligible. Even though it would deliver the necessary requirements to be deemed eligible.

This particular customer only had access to ADSL technologies at their exchange, so there was nothing else for them to use. Having to let them down was disappointing for us and certainly for them.

Situations like this beg the question of why? Surely doesn’t it defeat the whole point of allowing SME’s access to better connectivity if the supplier can meet the requirements with whatever technology is available at their exchange?

We don’t like letting customers down and when we registered for the scheme, we were excited at the possibility of providing a range of SME’s with a range of solutions.

After some recent questioning of the Department of Media Culture and Sport (DCMS), we were also informed that ADSL bonded with NGA technologies is completely disregarded as well. So businesses that have access to FTTC but need a bonded solution for failover, for example, can’t have that either.

If the idea is to give SMEs access to faster internet connectivity, it seems strange to us that a solution capable of doing just that isn’t eligible.

Of course, suppliers should be restricted to what they provide and over promising what an ADSL solution could deliver is a definite no. But at Evolving Networks we’re renowned for providing business class bonded ADSL solutions and think we have a very credible product on offer.

We’ve asked about appealing this decision, so will keep our readers updated as and when we can.

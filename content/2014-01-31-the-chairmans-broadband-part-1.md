Each and every time our Chairman has had a problem with his internet connection at home, we have said “so let’s put one of our bonded connections in then”.

It’s been slow, unreliable, and the support poor – this is an ADSL line from Sky.

We are finally going ahead with the upgrade of this single line to a bonded internet connection from Evolving Networks.

FTTC is available, and has been for some time, but that hasn’t been a big driver to upgrade, and I’ll tell you why: the estimate said 6mbps download.  Yes, 6Mbit/s – awful for FTTC.

Here is a classic example of a location that is probably classed as having access to “Superfast broadband” because it has access to FTTC, when in reality it is far from having fast speeds.

Since Openreach changed the estimates on FTTC speeds in their availability checker, we have been on the lookout for a site that actually has a range of speeds, or differing speeds between Range A and Range B.  See my other blog post <a href="/fttc-range-a-clean-and-fttc-range-b-impacted" target="_blank">here</a> about the changes to the broadband availability checker.

Now we finally have a location which is showing a big variance – the Chairman’s house!

We’ve decided to blog about the entire process from availability check through to installation and testing, so that people can get an idea of how a bonded connection will be installed, and also so we can post our success or failure at getting the best speeds quoted on the checker.

This is going to be a 2x Bonded FTTC connection so the installation will go as follows:

  * New line installed and enabled for FTTC (hopefully simultaneous provision)
  * Bonder installed, and LAN migrated to new connection
  * MAC obtained from Sky, and upgrade processed to FTTC along with migration to Evolving Networks
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> line goes live and completes the bonded FTTC connection

The next post will show the speed estimates from the broadband availability checker and how we proceed with the first line order.

At its best a bonded FTTC connection has better upload than FTTP on Demand, which I doubt this connection will give, but it will be very interesting to see how much of the variance in BT’s estimates are affected by internal wiring, or other factors beyond a customer’s control.

If they are beyond our control, then what’s the point of the range of speeds!  Let’s see how this goes…

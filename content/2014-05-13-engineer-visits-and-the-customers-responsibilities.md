Dealing with BT can sometimes be a hassle. When you order PSTNs from us, we hope to take that hassle out of the picture.

We make sure that an order is placed with BT and that their engineers know where to go so the lines can just be installed and the DSL can go live as soon as possible. The timeslots are decided by BT but we always try to work these appointments around the customer.

As soon as the date for the engineer visit has been confirmed, an automated email will be sent over to the customer from us to confirm the date and the timeslot. This email is very important and will need to be read through to know what will happen and what will need to be done.

For a normal installation, the engineer will turn up in his allocated timeslot (AM – 08:00-13:00 or PM 13:00-18:00) and ask you where you want the lines. He will then go off to the cabinet and have a fiddle about with some cabling and come back to install the lines. Easy.

So what can go wrong? If the person onsite hasn’t been informed that an engineer is coming, then the engineer will not be able to complete the work, and leave. Not only does this introduce delays to the order, but it also means that there is going to be a charge going out to the customer for wasting BT’s time.

Even worse than an engineer being turned away is an engineer being let in and left unattended. This is when an engineer will install the line in any old place and claim the work to be complete. He will then leave site, leaving the customer with a line in a place that they can’t use it. As the work is complete and the line is live, the engineer has fulfilled his duties and he will then be on his way. You can’t really blame him for that.

When the customer complains to us about this, unfortunately there isn’t much we can do. The most we can do is go back to BT and get a quote for an internal line shift. These normally start at about £500 and can go anywhere past £1000.

If it’s not the technical contact who is onsite at the time of installation, then someone else needs to be made aware that an engineer will coming to site to install PSTNs and they will need to know where they will be installed. This will save both time and money.

Evolving Networks, the leading provider of business graded bonded ADSL, are pleased to confirm delivery of a quad bonded ADSL solution to TCF Corporate. 

TCF Corporate is a facilitating backbone for the insurance sector, providing a fully outsourced fraud management solution, validating claims and fast-tracking honest policyholders whilst identifying fraud and securing robust evidence for repudiation. The bonded ADSL supply agreement further enforces Evolving Networks’ position as the market leaders for industrial strength bonded ADSL. 

Based in West Sussex, TCF Corporate’s rural location means that ADSL lines tend to be slow, and makes leased lines a very expensive alternative. 

With TCF corporate moving to a hosted application environment, a high capacity upload and download internet connection was needed. As with all businesses taking advantage of cloud computing solutions, resilience and reliability were also of paramount concern. 

During the sales process, Evolving Networks were very consultative, ensuring that they understood TCF Corporate, their business and their needs fully. Evolving Networks were then able to advise TCF Corporate appropriately and scale a bonded ADSL link to meet all needs without the expense of a leased line. 

A crucial element of the scaling of the new link, and a standard feature of all Evolving Networks bonded ADSL installations, eView Live provides Evolving Networks’ UK based engineers, and all customers, with real time statistics and graphs, as well as identifying and fixing any network problems immediately. 

By providing business grade bonded ADSL in West Sussex to TCF Corporate, Evolving Networks continue to set the bar high for bonded ADSL.

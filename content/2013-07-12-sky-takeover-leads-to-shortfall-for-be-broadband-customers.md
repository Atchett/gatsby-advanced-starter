**SKY takeover of BE Broadband stops their business bonded connections as of Autumn 2013, leaving their customers with just a single consumer line.</p> 

Evolving Networks can offer BE Broadband customers a bonded internet connection without the risk of losing it in the future.</strong>

This year will see a dramatic change in the Bonded ADSL Market as Be There Broadband is ceasing to supply their bonded connections as a result of a takeover by SKY.

As of autumn 2013 Be There Broadband will be removing all their bonded equipment from the exchange and reducing their bonded customers to a single line. This essentially means a downgrade in the service that business customers will have signed up for. 

The reduction from a bonded connection to a single line sees the loss of resilience and reliability with an increase in contention.

With SKY focussing on becoming THE major player in the consumer internet market, they are now neglecting their newly acquired bonded customers. 

Customers that want to keep their bonded connections will not have the option as the equipment is being withdrawn from the market and their connections downgraded.

At Evolving Networks we supply business class bonded connections. We pride ourselves on **resiliency** and **reliability** and give our customers the opportunity for **real-life data** throughput analysis through our online tool **[eView Live][1]**. 

If you are a BE There Broadband Customer and would like more information on what our bonded internet solutions could do for you, give us a call on **0330 55 55 333** or email **sales@evolving-networks.co.uk.**

Recent reports by ISP Review indicate that there has been a significant lack of uptake for the Governments Connection Voucher Scheme. It seems that most businesses already have good broadband connections or simply cannot afford the monthly costs which the scheme does not cover.

The scheme has been rather underwhelming with the amount of applicants opting in, this is an outcome that was not expected. Although there are said to be ‘thousands’ of applicants in the pipeline, only a small 4% (1,500) have actually been approved. This adds up to an average cost of about £2,300 which means that so far the total cost is likely to be £3.5 million out of the £100 million budget set.

It must be said that the Government has tweaked the original scheme, such as lowering the minimum grant from £250 to £200 and also simplifying the application process so a business only needs to obtain one quote from one supplier as opposed to two. However, it appears uptake hasn’t improved much.

Possibly due to the fact ADSL is not eligible for the scheme due to the fact that it isn’t a NGA technology and the vouchers are for newer and faster technologies, however for many smaller businesses the only real connection available is an ADSL line/connection. As it stands SME’s looking for broadband upgrades are unlikely to get them because fibre is not available in some areas of the UK.

So far the scheme is drastically under budget, maybe suggesting that there was simply not enough initial research into the project. Perhaps it was the rush to keep up other countries and their broadband roll out schemes?

Potentially because the scheme was brought out so quickly, the Government didn’t consider the businesses in urban areas who already have good broadband connections in place?

It seems to be out of twenty two cities, both big and small, only 1,500 applicants have been approved. Could it be due to a lack of knowledge about the scheme itself or could it be because the vouchers are used for NGA technologies which may either be unavailable or too expensive for businesses?

It seems that around 73% of premises in the UK do have access to FTTC, however there is still a relatively high percentage that cannot access it which is frustrating a lot of people.

Although 73% is a high percentage, and a figure said to be climbing, it still doesn’t seem enough. We as a country have so many different broadband providers with a lot of money being put into fibre technologies.

The concern is how long it will take to bring FTTC to all premises in the UK realistically, especially with the Connection Voucher Scheme only running till around March 2015. Well that only leaves about half a year to accept the remaining 96% of cases who want to use the vouchers for FTTC.

As many will know, here at Evolving Networks we have been working with Connecting Cambridgeshire to push the DCMS to allow bonded ADSL to become part of the scheme. This would allow many SME’s to get support to implement bonded ADSL if they are unable to get FTTC.

Also allow them to get better connectivity without incurring a very expensive cost of implementing a leased line. We promote the use of bonded ADSL because it is a reliable service that also provides the bandwidth many businesses need.

Although Bonded ADSL is not the only connectivity solution we provide, it is our most popular product because not only is it available in every UK location but we are also the bonded ADSL specialists.

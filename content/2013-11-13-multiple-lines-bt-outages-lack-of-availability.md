So today we saw a number of BT DSL circuits go down – both ADSL and FTTC.  Big outages are rare, and we forget sometimes that in years past it would not be out of character for BT to have outages lasting the better part of a day in certain areas.

Nowadays those bigger outages are rare, and if they last more than 2 or 3 hours then it’s really quite serious.

The causes are obviously varied, but like today, one thing is certain: the more lines you have, the better.

This is one of those messages that clearly can’t be delivered while a customer is suffering from an outage, nor should it be, but it is always interesting to look at eView Live during one of these kinds of outages and see the impact across the network.

The number of bonded connections down is always lower than the number of bonded connections that are still up but have at least one component line down.

What you can also see is that, in general terms, those with 4 or 5 lines either don’t go down at all, or their period spent down is a lot less.

A BT outage that might last 2 hours can be shortened to 30 minutes, or nothing at all, by having lots of lines, all running through a bonded internet gateway.

Another way of boosting resilience and lowering risk is to bond an LLU service, or a completely different technology.  You could for example, bond TalkTalk LLU with BT ADSL, or EFM with BT ADSL.

Of course these technologies have to be available in the local area which is a whole other topic I could choose to talk about!

Today, as a result of the outage we saw, of those customers of ours that were affected, the only ones that enquired about additional lines, and in particular other carriers, were all those that had no access to any LLU whatsoever.

Once more not only is it not economically viable for BT to provide ADSL2+ to those customers, it’s also not worth the other LLU providers forking out the money to do it either.

They all look at those areas with the highest concentration of subscribers – cities in general.

We have regular requests from customers who would like ADSL 2+, let alone FTTC, and we have to explain that BT are not prioritising business parks, let alone farms/forests/stately homes. Insert your favourite place here for BT to ignore.

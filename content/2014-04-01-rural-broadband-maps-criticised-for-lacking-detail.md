It seems that BT and the Government are under the spotlight again regarding the UK’s broadband rollout. This time – lack of detail, coverage and speeds (click [here][1] for article).

It appears that communication from BT has not been what it should when contracts have been won in areas earmarked for improvement, and that the maps released from BT are lacking detail of coverage and speeds.

There are some very interesting points made, significantly that the UK’s broadband is the fastest in Europe and its value for money, also that 90% of premises will have access to “superfast” downloads in 2015. With the lower costs of broadband in the UK compared with our European counterparts, surely it means that if customers are willing to pay more then maybe these figures can be improved?

With this “lack of detail” from BT, some businesses are finding it hard to fill the gaps when BT’s coverage is poor or lacking the throughput required. To be fair &#8211; surveys are needed to find the best way in delivering those increased speeds and unfortunately not everyone is going to get these due to location.

Its sounds a bit harsh but it simply isn’t cost effective to deliver 21<sup>st</sup> century technologies (ADSL 2+ and FTTC) to everyone, everywhere. And these things do take time.

Here at Evolving Networks the above doesn’t really affect us. We make the best of the technologies currently available to businesses. If BT do decide upgrade connectivity to one of the 21CN technologies – great! We will upgrade our customers free of charge and take advantage of the increased throughput and resilience of bonding multiple DSL technologies (FTTC and ADSL2+).

We can give you “superfast” throughput now by bonding multiple lines together and delivering a stable, reliable connection you require. There’s no lack of communication and each connection is tailored to your needs.

Just give one of our sales team a call on 0330 55 55 333 and a friendly adviser will help!

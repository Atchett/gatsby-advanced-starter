As part of Evolving Networks’ commitment to providing jobs and work experience for those at the start of their careers, they provide a 1 year university placement programme in their Marketing Department.

Since studying a degree in marketing and now coming to the end of my marketing placement, Evolving Networks have given me the opportunity to put theory from university into real life practice.

This past year has seen a lot of development in all areas of marketing which has been vital to my progress and understanding of the job role. From SEO management, Adwords development and website content to customer case studies, branding, the Blog launch and PR activities.

It has been really exciting to have an actual input in the decision making process within the Marketing Department, to learn about the nature of the business and see a business rapidly grow in its success.

The hardest part of the placement has been learning about the technology. It took some vital training and a lot of Q&A from my part, but it was important to ensure that the content I wrote was suitable and made sense. Luckily it always has.

I think the scariest part of the experience was moving to a completely new city without really knowing anyone. However, after my first day I felt welcomed by the team and couldn’t wait to get stuck in with the work.

With my departure also sees the arrival of the next marketing placement student. Wallis Butterfield, from Northumbria University, has been working with me to ensure we have a full handover and as of next week will be fully integrated into the role.

The past year has flown by and it is now time for me to go back to university for my final year. Thankfully to Evolving Networks, I am able to use the experience I have gained to help with writing my final dissertation.

My placement year has been one to remember. I am going to miss a lot of exciting new project launches that I have worked at the preparation stage for and hope Wallis enjoys the experience as much as I have. I wish every success to the whole team and that the company continues to grow from strength to strength!

Be sure to check out my first post about LLU here.

So how does the LLU landscape look now? Well the reason I started writing about this was because of O2 Wholesale withdrawing from the market.

Sky have bought the bits of BE and O2 consumer broadband, and as a result are not going to maintain the O2 LLU equipment any more in favour of their own.

They haven’t announced yet whether they will be replacing the O2 kit with their own (certainly doesn’t look like they will), or spread further into other exchanges at a decent rate.

What this means is that business users of O2 lines are all having to move to other providers.

The trouble is there aren’t really any viable alternatives to BTWholesale ADSL lines in most of the country.

If anything the problem has got worse since the introduction of LLU. Exchanges that serve rural communities and only have ADSL Max (IPStream) were in that position when LLU was announced.

We have plenty of customers with no predicted date of a BT upgrade to ADSL2+, let alone any LLU providers willing to take a look in.
  
What has happened since though? The FTTC rollout. ADSL2+ is now old hat, but the gap is even wider. If you have 2mbps ADSL Max, you’ll probably be quite frustrated with the constant talk of Fibre Broadband and 80mbps sync speeds.

At least when LLU providers first came about, they were only offering 20mbps. The gap gets wider between those customers left behind and those that get the latest greatest things.

BT Openreach have a universal service obligation, but they too have to make money to survive. I’m not sure what I would do if I had all the information in front of me, and I’m sure that you have to make money on the easy things before pushing the money towards those areas where it costs more to deliver the same thing.

But… it does seem a bit unfair that BT didn’t even finish the 21CN rollout to all exchanges before the massive FTTC rollout. LLU hasn’t helped those affected, and it won’t.

Last Week it was announced by the UK government’s Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) that the national roll-out, which was scheduled to take place later this year, has been hit by a (minimum) 3  month delay.  The delay has been caused due to concerns of competition in the process from the European Commission (EC).

Evolving Networks have previously documented that [the Government are investing £30bn into a nationwide roll-out to upgrade the UK][1] to superfast broadband as well as aiming to provide ultra-fast fibre optic based 80-100mbps broadband services to ten UK cities over the next three years.

However, a three month delay will cause businesses to look negatively at FTTC and wonder if they will ever be FTTC ready.

This latest delay first got attention in June 2012. The EC expressed concern over the lack in competition in the Broadband Delivery UK’s (BDUK) framework, which meant that no details could be issued with regards to financial aiding.

A DCMS spokesman was quoted saying “It is therefore unlikely that procurements will be completed by December (2012).  We are working on completing the procurements as rapidly as possible on the basis that the process started three months later than originally planned.”

With the latest delay occurring so soon before a predicted completion date, many of our customers, as well as readers, are probably curious if their location will ever be FTTC ready.  Luckily all of our customers will receive FTTC when we can provide it, and we’ll bond the fastest ADSL services available to you as standard until then.

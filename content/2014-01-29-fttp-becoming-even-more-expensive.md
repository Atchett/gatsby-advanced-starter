Yesterday BT Openreach has revealed that it is to increase its FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) prices.

The service has had such low demand that it is faced with the option of withdrawing the service all together or more than doubling its prices. In the last 12 months BT Openreach have been struggling with the 21CN rollout within some areas, appearing to stretch their resources to their limits and with higher than expected development costs of FTTP, BT Openreach have been forced into a drastic pricing restructure.

The FTTP service was promised to be the technology that will end all other internet connections but that is clearly not the case. In a news article ISP Review have claimed that 50% of premises could see a connection cost for FTTP of between £1,100 and £2,500, for a technology that is still in early market development with no guaranteed levels of service. This also is before any extra constructions charges that may apply when laying the fibre to the premises, and these can be tens of thousands of pounds!

FTTP is also currently limited to 30mbps upload, not exactly the mind blowing levels of upload we were all promised on fibre connections.

FTTP was hailed as the best thing since sliced bread, but with its high costs, modest upload and no guaranteed levels of service, it is being consistently out performed by our bonded FTTC services.

We are now bonding multiple FTTC lines, and even with a 2 x bonded FTTC solution the upload can exceed what is available on the FTTP service. Pair this with the resiliency of a bonded connection compared to a single line, plus our 99.9% SLA agreement. It’s no wonder there hasn’t been many adopters of the new FTTP service.

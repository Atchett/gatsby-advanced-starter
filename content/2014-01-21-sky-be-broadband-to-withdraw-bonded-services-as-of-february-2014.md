After what seems like months of speculation, it has finally been clarified that the BE Broadband bonded services will cease to be supplied or supported as of February this year.

The takeover of BE There Broadband by Sky last year set the wheels in motion for their bonded customers to be left with single line connectivity as the focus shifted to the consumer market, greatly reducing the level of service that their bonded customers will have signed up for.

According to current BE Broadband customers, February is the month in which bonded services will stop being supported. With only a short time for them to find an alternative provider of bonded ADSL services.

A shift from a bonded connection to a single line will affect customers in terms of decreased resiliency and speeds. For businesses with a need for a high quality connection, a single line solution may not be satisfactory.

Evolving Networks are committed to bonded connectivity and have been since the company’s launch in 2008. Running through a private UK network and with exclusive hardware, bonded solutions from Evolving Networks are resilient, uncontended, unthrottled and unmatched in terms of support and flexibility.

For BE Broadband bonded customers with the need for multiple line connectivity, Evolving Networks can help. With a seamless transition to the Evolving Networks private network and a dedicated deployments manager, BE customers can be assured their business’ connectivity needs won’t suffer.

Due to further growth within the company, once again at Evolving Networks we have recruited a new Apprentice, and this time in our marketing department. This very significant to us because this will be the first Apprentice to join the marketing team!

It has been a busy week so far with the allocated training for the new Apprentice who is learning the ropes with our marketing team.

And with another Apprentice set to join us in the coming weeks, we will be branching out our sales department even more.This is an exciting new development that could pave the way for further innovation within the company, leading to the opportunity for more Apprentices to join in the future.

As many people may know, Evolving Networks are big supporters of the Apprenticeship Scheme with a number of our senior staff having come to the company as Apprentices. We highly recommend the scheme as Apprentices contribute greatly to the development of our services and to the company as a whole.

** ****To increase the efficiency of your enterprise and reduce the stress of inferior internet connections, choose bonded ADSL**

It doesn’t take a genius to realise that the internet is an absolutely vital resource for the majority of businesses in existence, though of course to varying degrees. Some may just use the net to order stock or research competition while others will require constant high-speed connection to perform their daily duties and to keep their business running smoothly. Bonded ADSL is an innovative IT solution that can be extremely beneficial to all sorts of businesses and organisations and without it numerous problems can occur.  

**Common Problems without Bonded ADSL**

If you have had a job that requires permanent internet connection you will probably know how frustrating it is when the connection goes down and you are left essentially powerless, floating in a communications limbo where all you can do is sit and hope that the problem will be remedied soon. You will probably also be familiar with situations in which you are trying to send files, access websites or do any other task on the web and your connection is so slow that it feels like you have been waiting forever. As with the time lost when your internet connection is down completely, when your system is running painfully slowly your enterprise isn’t working as efficiently as it could, and that is where bonded ADSL could help.   

**What is Bonded ADSL?**

Bonded ADSL is a broadband internet system whereby several DSL connections are physically bonded together. These connections can be bonded SDSL or bonded ADSL connections. This process creates one single connection which is much faster than individual DSL connections, which is obviously advantageous to businesses and organisations that need fast and constant internet access.

**Bonded ADSL Benefits** 

Bonded ADSL ensures that constant internet access is achieved and this benefits businesses in a number of ways. It means that time is not wasted waiting for the web connection to return and the speed of bonded ADSL means that time is not wasted waiting for pages to load. Bonded ADSL enables you to do faster data transfers and faster uploads and downloads which are daily necessities in a multitude of enterprises. Bonded ADSL connections also allow you to send large files whether they are graphic files, image files, video files or audio files without the problems that this could cause with a lesser connection. With bonded ADSL it is also easy to set up conference calling which can save a business money on travel costs and time, while enabling you to keep in close contact with colleagues and clients. A major benefit of bonded ADSL is that it reduces the stress of an unreliable internet connection and this is vital in ensuring that staff are happy, which means that like your connection, they will work more efficiently.

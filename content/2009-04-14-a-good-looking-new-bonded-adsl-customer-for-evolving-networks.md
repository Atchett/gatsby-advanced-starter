Evolving Networks, provider of the UKs most innovate bonded ADSL solutions, are pleased to welcome Aspects Beauty to their ever expanding customer list.

Aspects are based in Lewes, East Sussex, and provide an all encompassing “brand caretaker” service to the luxury beauty industry. 

With customers ranging from Versace, to Moschino and Theo Fennell, reliable internet connectivity is crucial to Aspects.

Working with an advanced bonded ADSL solution from Evolving Networks means that the communications needs of the business are met, without the need for vastly expensive leased line services that their rural location would otherwise demand.

The bonded ADSL MAX Premium service delivered by Evolving Networks means that internet and email services are faster, as well as building resilience into the business connectivity solution to give everyone peace of mind.

By adopting a phased installation process, the bonded ADSL solution was installed and tested one link at a time.  The bonded ADSL solution was delivered on time, on budget and without any loss of connectivity.

I would love to supply everyone with Bonded FTTC, but unfortunately it’s not on the cards.  And here’s where the problem is – it’s not us at all – it’s all about how broadband is delivered in the UK.

In general, internet connections are delivered via cables – underground mostly, and sometimes via good old fashioned telegraph poles.  And that’s the key piece of information here – “old fashioned”.

The wires going into homes and businesses up and down the country are made of copper.  We call them copper pairs, as in actual fact you need two of them to make a phone line work.  Here again is what we’re dealing with – phone lines that have been retrofitted to be internet lines as well.

So why is location important?

Well, the speed of the internet line is dependent on two things that in themselves are both dependent on the location.

  1. How long the copper line is from the local telephone exchange and your green street cabinet
  2. What broadband products BT have installed at your exchange and cabinet

So if you just have ADSL Max in your area, then that restricts how fast your connection will be, and then if you are far away from your exchange, then that slows it down even more.

If you are lucky enough to have ADSL 2+, then that boosts the speeds available, but only for people closer to the exchange, so those far away probably won’t see an increase.

FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) is the very latest broadband being rolled out – what BT brand as Infinity when they sell it, although the actual product is called FTTC and can be sold by any compatible ISP.  The speed of this is also dependent on how far BT have got with installing it, and also the distance from your cabinet.

We sell all 3, and bond them all together giving as much speed as a customer can get or need depending on location.  That’s the important bit again: location.  If you can only get 1mbps ADSL Max then we can’t offer you a 3 x Bonded FTTC connection delivering 200mbps!  We’d love to be able to, but it all depends on what’s available in your area.

Unfortunately, and I’m sure there are a number of reasons for this, consumers and businesses have, over the years, been given a confused message about how fast a connection they can get, and how much is dependent on the ISP they choose, and how much on the product available and their location.

We still get potential customers asking us for things that cannot be delivered, such as FTTC.  We still get people confused by the term “up to” used by many ISPs.  You don’t find a single mention of speed figures on our website, and that’s because every quote we do is specific to the location given by the potential customer, and backed up with all the reasons why.

I’ve been in the situation with customers, where because they can’t afford anything other than Bonded ADSL (so not EFM or Ethernet for example), but the Bonded ADSL is only delivering 3 or 4mbps (because that’s all the lines can deliver), that I have actually put to them that they consider moving offices.

Change your location, change what products and speeds are available to you.  Of course that then becomes a serious business decision that must be based on hundreds of other factors other than internet speed, but it is a valid consideration none the less.

We’ll always quote you the speeds available in the most accurate way we can, based on the locations you give us – and its always best with a phone line number.  I think I’ll talk more in a future post about how there are still pitfalls to even this approach, but once again, we do everything we can to give as accurate an estimate as we can to customers before they proceed.

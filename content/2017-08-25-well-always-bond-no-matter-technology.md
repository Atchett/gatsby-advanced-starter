## Making internet connections better

Evolving Networks was founded because we thought we could make internet connections better.

Bonding had been done before, but not well, and while strapping together multiple internet connections is only part of the story, it is the foundation that we work on with every connection we deliver.

Many companies have tried selling [bonded ADSL][1], but none have had the right mindset when it comes to quality.

If a constituent line stops passing traffic, do you really want to wait 10 seconds, maybe more, for your connection to stop sending packets to it?

You’d really feel that if you were accessing a website at the time. You’d probably lose your VoIP call if you were on one.

## Is that really bonding?

If there is a 10% “overhead” for each line that you add, is that really aggregating your bandwidth?

A 4x bonded connection shouldn’t have 40% less bandwidth than the 4 underlying lines – that’s crazy.

And of course if you bond contended lines, then you are asking for trouble.
  
This is what we’ve been up against, certainly in the UK.

So for those people who have tried bonding and are fearful of trying it again, let me make it very clear that we aren’t your average bonding provider.

## When we do it, we do it well

Bonding internet connections together, with no increase in latency, with no loss of aggregated bandwidth, with instantaneous failover, uncontended and unlimited is the basis for every connection we sell.

We cracked that years ago, and have since been adding packet prioritisation for [QoS][2], [compression][3] and other [optimising techniques][4].

And we will keep on bonding, no matter the technology that comes our way.

When we started we bonded ADSL (1 and 2mbps fixed), ADSL Max and SDSL.

Now, even though the broadband industry cycle continues to turn, giving us first ADSL 2+, then FTTC, now FTTP and eventually G.Fast, we will keep on bonding.

## Whatever technology comes our way, we&#8217;ll bond It

We will bond any and all of these things, in whatever combination works for our customers.

We were the first to [bond ADSL][1] and SDSL together. The first to [bond FTTC][5].
  
We were first to bond ADSL 2+ and EFM, and now we are bonding FTTP and even Ethernet at gigabit speeds.

Businesses and consumers alike will always want more bandwidth, and will increasingly see resilience as what they have been seriously missing out on.

## Bonding &#8211; not a stop gap

Bonding isn’t the stop gap technology so many always assumed it was.

And if its done well, gives a seamless, resilient, powerfully agile connection that can dramatically improve a business’s internet connection, or become the building block for a [Software Defined WAN][6] spanning many hundreds of sites.

Traditional [SD-WAN][6]s use policy-based routing (PBR) and not bonding.

When you take the power you get from the true aggregated throughput of bonding and add on the other features of SD-WAN you get a seriously high quality connection, suitable for any corporate WAN.

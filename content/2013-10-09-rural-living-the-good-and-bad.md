Ah, the countryside. A popular holiday and weekend break destination and it’s no surprise. For those lucky people that get to live in picturesque rural towns in the UK, there are lots of positives. The peaceful and tranquil days and nights is something that all city dwellers will envy at some point. No traffic, less people. You really do avoid the hustle and bustle of urban living.

Low crime rates, waking to the sound of wildlife, vast open spaces and clean air. It really is a lifestyle to be envious of. But by living in the countryside, it also means you choose certain things. Such as being far away from things, which can be both a good and bad thing. For example, it’s not so easy to get to your local takeaway or fill up your car. Unfortunately it’s the same with access to superfast internet.

Premises in the countryside tend to be a lot further from the exchange and it’s a rare sight to see a lovely green cabinet on the roadside. Well, thankfully the Government have noticed and the rural broadband rollout is well underway.

However, like most things in life, there have been a few problems. The original aim was for 90% of UK premises to have access to superfast broadband by 2015. This was then pushed back to an aim of 95% by 2017, which of course caused controversy between political parties.

Another issue that has raised eyebrows is the clear dominance that BT has in the market. According to reports, BT has won <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every </span>deal that the Government has offered. This means they are set to benefit from £1.2 billion of public funding. Critics have accused BT of exploiting the deal. But what should be considered before all hell is fired at BT is, can any other provider do it like they can?

Amid claims that the taxpayer is being ripped off by the rollout scheme, David Cameron has said that criticism of the scheme is “slightly unfair” as apparently 10,000 extra premises’ are getting superfast broadband every week. So why all the opposition?

It really is something that has a benefit and a problem at every turn. We’ll be keeping a close eye on the scheme as it develops and we’ll be posting more blog articles on it in the coming weeks. Maybe the Government has got ahead of itself, maybe opposes are over exaggerating? It seems to be all up in the air at the moment.

So for you countryside businesses, the future is uncertain. If you’re still suffering from slow speeds and rubbish connectivity with no real estimation of when you’ll be getting access to superfast broadband, we can help you out.

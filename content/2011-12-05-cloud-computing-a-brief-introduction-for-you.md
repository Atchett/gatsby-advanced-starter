Over the last few years, you will have probably have heard people use the term “Cloud Computing”. Well, you may be hearing it more often in the coming months and years, and you do not want to be left confused. So what is the best way to describe cloud computing?

Cloud computing refers to internet-based servers offered to customers on a rental basis. As an alternative to housing servers yourself, cloud computing gives businesses access to resilient servers in serious data centres. 

Cloud computing offers much more scalability than in-house servers, often providing a more secure and reliable option. In the past you may have purchased a specific amount of hard drive space only to be in the market for another hard drive, or an alternative solution a few weeks later. Cloud computing means you can easily top up the amount of space available to you at the click of a button.

A major advantage to using cloud computing is the ability to share documents to enable collaborative working, with geographically diverse team members able to securely access and amend documents online.

As mentioned above, you or your colleagues will be able to access information whether you are in the office, travelling or at home via mobile, laptop or tablet. Therefore giving you the peace of mind that you can create, edit or share documents wherever, whenever.

A further advantage to cloud computing is that there is no need to download anything as it can be accessed online saving local hard drive space and the need to share large files across the WAN.

This is a brief introduction to cloud computing for you. Over the coming weeks and months we will be bringing you more articles on cloud computing to detail how it can benefit you and your business.

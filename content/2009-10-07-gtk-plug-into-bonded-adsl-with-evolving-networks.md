GTK UK Ltd, the leading component and connector manufacturer is the latest company to take advantage of the cutting edge managed bonded ADSL solutions offered by Evolving Networks.

Relocating a business is always a major change and one that needs to be planned and managed very carefully to ensure both a smooth transition, and that the business benefits immediately from the new premises. 

When moving their UK headquarters to a new 10,000 sq ft custom designed facility in Basingstoke, GTK also integrated their manufacturing division and Head office, which were previously in two separate locations.

Such a major undertaking generated two significant internet supply requirements.  Firstly a solution needed to be found that would could be installed on time and on budget, ready for staff to arrive for their first day’s work in the new facility.  Secondly, due to the integration of two previously separate operations, the new internet solution needed to be able to handle the immediate requirement for increased bandwidth, with scope for growth potential in the future.

Having conducted a rigorous analysis of the UK business ISP market, bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks was selected as having the speed of installation, capacity and flexibility to meet the demanding needs of GTK.

When speaking to a number of different bonded ADSL suppliers, GTK were impressed with the strength of the bonded ADSL offering and the quality of the data available to Evolving Networks’ bonded ADSL customers.

Evolving Networks clients have access to the industry’s most advanced control panel application.  This delivers the ability to monitor the status and performance of a bonded ADSL solution at all times, providing the UK’s most flexible bonded ADSL solution.  This incredibly powerful platform not only allows each customer to see the capacity & throughput of their bonded ADSL solution, but also allows Evolving Networks to offer truly proactive service.

For GTK, the choice of bonded ADSL supplier was clear.

We have been bonding internet connections very successfully for a number of years now and because we love a challenge, we’re always looking for new ways to make our connections even better.

One of our previous blog posts talked about Compression and how it can make the performance of a connection just generally perform better. Since then, we’ve developed this further and have worked hard to get it just right.

We’ve been working on a number of compression technologies, because there’s not just one type of packet that needs compressing. This is where we introduce our clever product that we like to call, Bandwidth Amplification.

Because of our core network infrastructure and most recent (and very clever) hardware, we have a higher control over how bandwidth flows. This has allowed us to get smart, and we can now save bandwidth in a number of ways by compressing large data files on the fly.

Bandwidth Amplification is now live on a number of our customer’s connections and we’re happy to say it is doing its job nicely. We’re still developing ways to make it even better, but that’s all part of the Evolving Networks philosophy.

We’ll be talking about this a lot more in future posts, so keep an eye out for those! And as always, if you want to learn more about Bandwidth Amplification, call our specialists on 0330 55 55 333.

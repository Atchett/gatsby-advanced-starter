We love bandwidth here at Evolving Networks, but what we also love is network cleverness. We are always working on new ways of improving internet connections and have reached some important milestones with our new data compression algorithms.

On our own single FTTC circuit synced at 70Mbps, we have achieved online speedtest results of more than 280Mbps download. Our latest hardware and core infrastructure is allowing us to dramatically increase the available bandwidth to customers through intelligent data packet management.

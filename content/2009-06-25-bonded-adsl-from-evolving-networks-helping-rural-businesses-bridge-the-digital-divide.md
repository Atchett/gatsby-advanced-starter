Recent reports detailing the challenges of meeting the government target of delivering at least 2mbps broadband speeds to all UK homes by the end of 2012 have made the national media.  However, what has not been highlighted is the challenges faced by businesses based in rural areas.

Many small and medium sized businesses are not based in towns, instead choosing to locate themselves in rural and semi-rural areas.  There are many advantages to this, not least of which can be the picturesque views and general “quality of life” enjoyed by staff.

Commuting to rural offices is often easier, without the need to take on the urban rush hour traffic jam or cramped train journey.  Staff needing to get out and meet customers can often find it more efficient not to be based in the middle of a city, which can add significantly to journey times when visiting customers elsewhere.

Inevitably there is a trade off, and one of the biggest is communications.  Without access to the high speed fibre rings available in the centre of London for example, internet connectivity can be a problem.  Delivering fibre or leased lines to many rural businesses is cost prohibitive, with carriers demanding excessive installation costs and very long lead times.

Evolving Networks is meeting this need with its bonded ADSL solutions.  By delivering truly bonded ADSL internet links to businesses, high speed internet access is now available to all businesses regardless of location.

The Evolving Networks bonded ADSL network is nationwide, with no discrimination made to rural communities, if you can get an ADSL service, you can get a bonded ADSL service from Evolving Networks.

Bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks works by establishing connectivity simultaneously over multiple tails into a client site.  A public IP range is applied centrally and routed through the network, rather than being tied to any specific ADSL tail.  This delivers a bonded ADSL connection that increases both up & download capacity, as well as delivering a resilient connection that maintains service even in the event of a complete loss of connectivity on individual ADSL circuits.

With a rapidly expanding customer base – both in urban and rural areas – Evolving Networks are setting the bar high for bonded ADSL solutions in the UK.  All connections are delivered with a rigorous Service Level Agreement, and all customers have access to the industry’s most advanced management portal, allowing end users to see the status and performance of their bonded connection in real time.

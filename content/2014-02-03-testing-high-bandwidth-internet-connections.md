Our position on online speed test sites has always been pretty clear – we don’t like them, and we don’t think they are accurate.

There have been other posts on the problems surrounding them, so let’s talk about something new, which is the rise of higher bandwidth connections, and how it becomes even more difficult to “check” the speed.

The current crop of FTTC connections will deliver anything up to a maximum throughput of around 70-74mbps.  This top end would be an 80/20 line at absolutely peak condition.  As per usual, most are slower than this, and it all depends on your distance from the cabinet, etc. etc.

Even at this speed, testing can get unreliable, but once you start moving past a single FTTC and into bonding multiple lines together to breach the 100 megabit barrier it becomes even more difficult.

What we’re currently embarking upon is a concerted effort to come up with reliable and proven test methodologies to prove connections in the 100+ range work as they should.

But what are the problems we face?

First of all, what if the customer has a firewall which doesn’t have gigabit ports?

If it does have gigabit ports, what if the firewall can’t process more than say 150mbps because it’s not beefy enough?

How about the LAN switch? Or the computers themselves? They all need the port speed and backplane necessary to shift these large amounts of data.

Then there is the internet itself and what you connect to.

It’s pretty useless if the server you need to use on the internet can’t handle the same speed as you.  You just won’t see the full benefit of your connection.

Add WiFi to that as well, and you can forget high speeds being something you “see”.

That doesn’t mean the bandwidth isn’t there and available to you though – which is why we are focusing on helping our customers see and feel the benefits of having a high bandwidth bonded internet connection.

Watch this space for more test results and discussion on how we go about doing this, and the tribulations along the way.

Evolving Networks are pleased to welcome Thales Air Defence to their ever expanding customer list.  The agreement to supply bonded ADSL to Thales managed sites further builds Evolving Networks’ impressive list of defence contractor customers.

Thales is the European leader in defence systems**,** providing high-tech products and systems to meet the requirements of air, land, naval and joint forces and is another example of a leading global business with demanding requirements putting their trust in bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks.  The agreement further consolidates the position of Evolving Networks as the leading supplier of bonded ADSL solutions to the defence industry.

The unique Evolving Networks control panel, which allows for real time monitoring of the status and throughput of each bonded DSL solution, was a key factor in the decision of another leading global organisation to source bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks.  In addition to providing complete peace of mind as to the status of each individual ADSL tail within a bonded ADSL solution, the control panel is a crucial tool for capacity planning, allowing businesses with growing throughput needs to visualise and plan onsite capacity in order to meet the needs of end users.

By delivering bonded ADSL solutions through a private network, with a public IP range applied centrally, increasing capacity is quick and easy, with no configuration changes needed.  The control panel gives each customer a dashboard application to allow them to manage and plan additional capacity, and ensure that each bonded ADSL solution is performing to its optimum at all times.  This control panel was a key factor Thales’ decision to work with Evolving Networks.

Gerry White, Business Development Director at Evolving Networks said, “This is another example of a business with demanding requirements choosing Evolving Networks for their bonded ADSL.  The transparency and manageability that comes with our control panel application was a key factor in clinching the deal.  Putting industrial strength bonded ADSL solutions into demanding environments is what we are all about and we welcome Thales and look forward to working with them over the coming years”.

Evolving Networks is a leading provider of bonded ADSL solutions for the defence, public and private sector.  With the most flexible bonding platform in the industry and an uncontended private network, Evolving Networks are the supplier of choice to organisations who depend on their internet connectivity.

FTTC has been hallmarked as the be all and end all of connectivity and we consistently see promises of it delivering higher throughputs and improved performance for residents and businesses across the UK. But as we’ve talked about in previous blog posts, it is all very much location dependent and not just in the sense of whether you can actually get it or not!

I recently spoke with an enquirer who was interested in bonded ADSL as their single ADSL connection had left them suffering from poor performance. They were based in a remote location and fibre Ethernet was simply too expensive for them.

They were interested in adding more services to their business which required more bandwidth, so of course they were looking for something with better capabilities.

Following normal procedure, I ran a check on their PSTN to see what was available and it was quite interesting to see the results. What I found was that, in this particular customer’s location, they had FTTC available…but it was slower than ADSL2+.

Due to their premises being so far away from the nearest cabinet, and FTTC not being designed to run the copper aspect over long distances, they’d achieve a better connection through sticking with traditional ADSL2+ but bonded to increase throughputs and resilience.

This is a point we’ve been trying to get across for a while now in that FTTC is all well and good if you are located in a place where not only is it available, but also that you’re close enough to the cabinet for the investment into it to be worthwhile.

So, regardless of the fixed line technologies available at your business’ location, we tailor make our connectivity solutions to meet your needs. If you want resiliency, then of course we would recommend a bonded FTTC and ADSL solution.

For more information give one of our specialists a call on 0330 55 55 333 or email <sales@evolving-networks.co.uk>.

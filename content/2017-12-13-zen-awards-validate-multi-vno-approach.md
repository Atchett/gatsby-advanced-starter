## Evolving Networks Wins Two Awards

Zen Internet have awarded us Connectivity Partner of the Year 2017 and overall Partner of the Year 2017.

When we integrate a new VNO partnership into our SDN Platform, it goes through a rigorous testing regime, as well as essential network compatibility checks.

Remember, every connection from Evolving Networks is supplied with multiple circuits from separate, non-overlapping, high performance VNO platforms.

## Comprehensive Multi-VNO Structure

Choosing, tailoring and managing those VNO agreements and integrating with those VNO networks is a complex and time-consuming business, but it leads to an access network that we overlay with our Intelligent Network Fabric delivering software-defined always-on connections.

The only SDN platform of its kind in the country, our Multi-VNO Access Network allows us to deliver truly resilient connectivity to our customers, without them having to worry about where to buy their broadband from and how to fix it when it breaks.

## Integration Into SDN Platform

By integrating tightly into our provider networks at an API level and having managed modem nodes and network virtualisation appliances providing telemetry and responding to commands, our automated orchestration systems remotely diagnose and fix broadband issues on the fly, often without any human intervention.

## SD-WAN Platform Recognition

Whether its for a full SD-WAN or just a single internet connection for a small office, our unique SDN ecosystem supports and delivers high uptime, high quality connectivity, prioritised for cloud applications.

As we have ramped up our usage of the Zen network over the last 2 years, our relationship has gone from strength to strength.

It’s great to get the recognition from key suppliers that we’re on the right track.

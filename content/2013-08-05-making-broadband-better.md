ADSL has been around for a fair while now.  It’s still the most common home broadband connection, and most businesses around the country rely on it too to keep them connected.

What we have spent considerable time and effort on, is trying to improve every aspect of ADSL, from it’s delivery to it’s stability, and speed.

ADSL is still here to stay.  Despite promises of upgrades to FTTC and other technologies, the roll outs are slow and the coverage of the country will remain patchy.  Even when targets are hit, they are still only a percentage of the country and not a complete replacement.

So what can you do to make the experience of ADSL and all forms of broadband better for the end user?

When we designed our core bonded ADSL product, we thought about all the things that annoyed us from working with previous companies and ISP connections.  The lines drop out, are limited by location, and the speeds can change (sometimes violently).

How do we get around these problems?  Well first of all, we bond multiple lines together.  This is completely transparent to the end user and gives a single Ethernet port for a customer’s firewall to connect to.  Giving the sum total of the bandwidth of all the connection lines, there is an instant and massive speed boost over a single line.

What this also gives is protection against drop outs.  What ADSL lines resync, which is perfectly normal, you would usually be offline while you wait for it to complete.  With multiple lines, this sometimes everyday occurrence is virtually eliminated.  While one line is resyncing, the others continue passing data and keep you online.

So what about sudden changes in speed or normal line faults?  This is where eView Live comes in.  We’ve built our monitoring and analytics platform from the ground up to keep an eye on every ADSL line we have.  Constant checking means that when eView sees a problem developing, it immediately flags it up to our support engineers and can even act to perform the first steps of diagnostics automatically.

What this means for end users is that problems that would have taken you offline, or days of back and forth with your ISP can be stopped before they manifest themselves, or worked around while we fix them.

This work is ongoing, and as we develop new ways of diagnosing and monitoring our connections, we add them to eView Live, and we’ll start talking about them here as well!

All in all, our aim is to make broadband better.

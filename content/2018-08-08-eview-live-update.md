Our in-house UK software developers and network engineers are always working on things that make connectivity better, improve how we interact with others, and make us more efficient and scalable.

On any given day they could be working on integrating systems with suppliers, building new network event detection mechanisms, or adding new SD-WAN features to our products.

2018 has been a busy year already for us, with an expansion in the number of SD-WANs delivered, a move to larger premises and an increase in staffing across the business, particularly in dev.

What we’re announcing today is a new full update to eView Live our network analytics and orchestration platform.

Behind the scenes we have been adding functionality that allows us to more easily administer your connectivity, react to network events, and improve diagnostics.

But now it’s time for our customer facing portal to get a makeover.  The eViewLive portal is an essential tool in managing your connectivity – whether it’s checking traffic levels, link health, or looking at past usage.

What this new design gives us is not only an improved experience on both mobiles and large screens, but a platform for adding new features and functionality easily accessible through one login.

The new eView Live is faster, slicker, and needs fewer clicks to get to what you want.  Data loads near instantly and scales to your screen size.  Detailed live throughput can now be scrolled back 20 hours instead of 3 – invaluable for diagnosing LAN and WAN issues.

A new simplified menu structure gives us the scope to add additional options easily, so keep an eye out for further announcements as we add important updates.

We also rely on and welcome your feedback.

Don’t just assume that someone else might have spotted something that’s not quite right, or think that if something was useful someone else would have thought of it.

By having our own dedicated network software development resource, we have the power to make whatever changes we need, and who better to help us with that than the people using our products.

So if you like what you see, let us know, and if you don’t or have an idea for an improvement, please let us know as well.

Whether its for a connectivity feature request or a simple bug report for eView Live, email <dev@evolving.net.uk> and it will go straight to our devs.

What other SD-WAN company gives that level of access to the guys building the product?

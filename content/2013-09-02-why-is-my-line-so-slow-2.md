&#8220;Why is my line so slow?&#8221;

It&#8217;s a common question that all broadband users will have in mind at some point in time, whether you’re using a connection at home or from work.

So, what can you do as an Evolving Networks customer to check the speed of your connection?

We provide our clients with a real time network monitoring tool, eView Live.

eView Live monitors your connection 24/7, 365 days a year, checking for anything which may affect the performance of your bonded internet connection.

Logging into eView Live allows you to view your network’s stat’s including; live data traffic, sync speeds & the status of each individual line.

By accessing the built-in usage graphs, it’s possible to locate periods of peak usage and even help diagnose internal network issues such as constant uploads, which will saturate the connection bandwidth. The Health Check Tab provides more in-depth statistics on each individual line. It displays the current up & down Sync Speeds giving a good indication of the current state of the connection, the SNR margin which ideally should be between 6 &10 and the attenuation (the distance from site to the exchange).

If your unable to resolve the issue with the help of eView live then please ALWAYS contact our technical support team on 0330 55 55 333. Our main support line is open from 8:00am – 6:00pm. Any out of hours issues should be reported to our email support team at <support@evolving-networks.co.uk>. You’ll be safe in the knowledge that we have dedicated engineers working around the clock on our connections.

Never under any circumstances should you fall into the common old habit of simply rebooting the equipment every time the connection slows down. There are several good reasons why. Firstly this may cause further issues, secondly this is very likely to just prolong the period until the issue appears again and thirdly we lose all of our system logs. Our equipment intelligently records the status of your connection. There are often key pieces of information in the logs which help the technical support team diagnose your issue and fix it in the shortest time possible.

Many home & business broadband customers use certain speed test sites to monitor the speeds of their connection. At Evolving Networks our experience has taught us not to rely on these for an accurate indication of your connection speed. Our next blog post is going to detail just exactly why this is.

We have had an extremely busy and exciting few weeks here at Evolving Networks as our latest recruitment drive brings two new apprentices to the team.

Our new apprentices have joined us for positions in our sales and accounts teams and we are set to hire further apprentices to join our technical teams in the coming months.

The latest recruitment drive follows a further expansion for Evolving Networks and tops off a fantastic year so far.

Apprentices are a valuable part of the team and some of our senior staff members have come through apprenticeships which speaks volumes. It is a scheme that has proved invaluable for us and we&#8217;d urge any business to consider it.

And we are still on the lookout for more! With new projects underway, we need apprentices for our technical teams.

It is great to see our team expanding and we can&#8217;t wait for the exciting times to come!

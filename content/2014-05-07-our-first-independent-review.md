We recently blogged about working with Increase Broadband Speed as part of an independent review of our services, all with the intention of raising the awareness of bonded internet to UK businesses.

[Part 1][1] of their review is now live and we are already seeing more people coming through and asking us about bonded internet (yay!).

They are currently testing bonded ADSL and as and when FTTC becomes available, they will be testing bonded FTTC with us as well.

What we have been really grateful for to the Increase Broadband Speed team is how enthusiastic they have been throughout the whole process so far. We could not have asked for a more in-depth insight into our service from a customer’s point of view and this has been extremely useful for all the Evolving Networks team.

They have highlighted some very interesting points and we can guarantee that all feedback, positive and negative, has been taken on board. We want to make our service the best it can possibly be for our customers – old, new and prospective!

As the extended trial with Increase Broadband Speed continues, we are looking forward to reading more reviews about other aspects of the service.

Independent reviews are a crucial part of developing operations even further as we are given real insight into how we can improve, all for the end user.

We’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you very much to the Increase Broadband Speed team and we are looking forward to developing this relationship even further.

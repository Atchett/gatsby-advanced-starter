Once a customer has liaised with the sales team about their requirements, the Deployment Team work closely with suppliers to ensure there is a smooth transition to all the requested services.

Deployment is vital for the flow of business within Evolving Networks as it helps to set the scene for the week (shipping, stock levels, order flow).

Each customer has a dedicated deployments manager. This ensures that each customer has all the needed contact about the status of their connection. It also means that customers are always put through to the same person who knows their situation and this lets the customer get to know the process.

“The deployment role involves the shipping of kit to the customer and the installation of lines into the premises so that we can deliver our service to them. Communication skills are key as we like to keep the customer informed of any important dates, whether this is the arrival of kit, installation of a line or live date of the DSL. As well as making sure that the technical team are aware that the kit will need configuring and shipping by a given date and making sure that the customer is aware of installation and shipping dates is imperative.

We are always pushing for the earliest possible date for anything, whether this is a BT PSTN installation of the live date of DSL. Whatever we do we like to get it in early. This means completing with BT to get them to sort any order issues, such as a lack of copper pairs. The sooner the connection is in, the sooner we will have a happy customer. We work on an average of a 15 working day lead time, but always aim to beat this, (and often do)!

It is rare that there are major delays from BT, but as soon as we know about one we let all of our customers that have an order on the system know. Keeping the customer informed is key!&#8221;– **Operations Manager – Ben Wright**

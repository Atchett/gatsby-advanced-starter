IPv6 is the next generation protocol for the Internet, having been designed to provide numerous advantages over the current Internet Protocol Version 4. 

IPv4 is the most commonly used Internet layer protocol and at the writing of this article is used by the vast majority of devices connected to the Internet.

There are over four billion possible IPv4 addresses that can be used. However due to the increase in usages of smartphones, laptops and tablets, theses addresses are running out quickly. 

Earlier in the year the IANA announced that “The future of the Internet is in IPv6. All Internet stakeholders must now take definitive action to deploy IPv6.” This is due to the last IPv4 addresses having been allocated. At Evolving Networks we believe that in 2012, the switch over from IPv4 to IPv6 will begin to gather serious momentum.

So what is IPv6 and how is it different to its predecessor?

Internet Protocol version Six (IPv6) was originally developed in the 90’s as an alternative to IPv4. Unlike the IPv4 which uses a 32-bit system, the IPv6 uses a 128-bit addresses meaning that there are 2128 individual addresses offered. 

IPv6 will provide enough addresses to allow the internet to continually evolve and with give the industry plenty of scope for innovation. However, IPv6 is not compatible with IPv4, meaning that an IPv4 device cannot directly communicate with a device which is connected using IPv6.

Being able to successfully manage a global switch over from IPv4 to IPv6 requires pro-active steps on the part of the big industry players. To date they have not shown any real appetite to accelerate the uptake of IPv6, but with the number of IPv4 addresses being slowly drained, businesses need to be aware of their need to adopt IPv6 to cope with future growth of the internet. 

At Evolving Networks we believe that in 2012 we will start to see some of the major players in the consumer market start to take IPv6 more seriously. Compatible routers and modems will start to become more widespread, and this will speed up adoption of the service with ISPs.

We’ve been working hard to upgrade our network so that we can provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connections into the future. We commit to providing IPv6 connections to our customers when the conditions are right to do so, taking our customers forward and helping their businesses evolve.

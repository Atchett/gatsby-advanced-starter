We’ve had a lot more ADSL migrations failing recently.  2 customers in particular have had a less than smooth start with us after their MAC codes (Ok, I just fell for the trick there of saying code codes, but you get what I mean) failed twice in a row.

It seems like more than co-incidence that both of these customers had MACs failing in the same month, and both twice, but what it makes me think about is the problem of having something out of your hands and a customer thinking it’s your fault.

It also raises the argument of how much we should warn a customer of the potential problems that they might face when placing an order with us.

I’m sure our sales team would love it if I told them that from now on before anyone signs up, they must be informed of the chances that a MAC will fail, or a PSTN will be delayed, or Openreach tells them something a bit unhelpful.

Migrations usually take 5 days.  When we sell our products, or deal with a deployment that is what we say.  We use the word usually or normally, definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> definitely!

But when a customer has even the slightest delay because the BT system has said “err, no” without much detail, sometimes it’s difficult to appease them.

I certainly don’t blame them for being disappointed that the expectations we set (even if we say usually and not definitely) are not being met, especially if they need an increase in speed and resilience as soon as possible to alleviate their problems.

All I will ever ask in these situations is please bear with us as much as you can.

We will always get lines activated as soon as is physically possible for us (let’s face it, we want to bill you for it and can’t if it’s not live!).

If there are problems, we have dedicated deployments staff whose job it is to keep hassling BT Openreach or BT Wholesale until we get what we need and a customer can go live.  It’s not in our interest to introduce delays and we do everything we can to make deployments as smooth and as quick as possible.

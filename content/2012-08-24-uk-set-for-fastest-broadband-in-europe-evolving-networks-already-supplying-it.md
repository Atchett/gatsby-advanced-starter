Jeremy Hunt MP, Culture Secretary, claims that within 3 years Britain could have the best broadband in Europe; with plans to ensure the delivery of superfast broadband – more than 24mpbs to 90% homes and the spread of speeds of up to 100mpbs.

However, shadow minister Helen Goodman suggested that without a coherent plan, 3 years is an underestimated time frame.

Evolving Networks strongly support the Superfast Broadband commitment that the Government have put in place. For businesses this means greater speeds in both rural as well as poorly supplied urban areas.

Whilst the transition continues for the projected three years, Evolving Networks continue to provide resilient bonded internet connections to businesses throughout the UK, ensuring they can harness the potential of cloud computing and stay one step ahead of the competition.

Importantly to Evolving Networks’ ever increasing portfolio of UK business customers, each bonded internet connection supplied by Evolving Networks is fully future proofed. When you purchase an evolving internet connection from Evolving Networks, you are ensuring your business will stay at the cutting edge of internet connectivity for the foreseeable future.

Unsure of exactly what you will get from a bonded ADSL solution?

Evolving Networks are always at the front of the queue when it comes to innovation in bonded ADSL and now we are announcing a further development. As bonded ADSL supplier of choice to the defence, public and private sector clients, Evolving Networks specialise in delivering bonded ADSL solutions into demanding environments.

Now we are proud to announce another first. If you are considering a bonded ADSL solution but you are unsure of exactly what you will see in terms of throughput on your new solution, we have the answer.

Evolving Networks are offering a free audit of your existing ADSL connection for a period of one week. We will give you a report with recommendations and a clear idea of potential throughput likely to be seen with a bonded ADSL solution.

Evolving Networks operate the industry’s leading online bonded ADSL portal, eView Live. This system allows all our bonded ADSL, bonded SDSL and single link connectivity customers to monitor the status and performance of their solution in real time. This commitment to transparent service delivery is just one of the key factors that has allowed Evolving Networks to establish and maintain our prestigious base of bonded ADSL customers.

Now we are opening this platform up to prospective customers as well, helping to make the bonded ADSL purchasing decision even easier. Gerry White, Business Development Director for Evolving Networks, “there is a lot of marketing nonsense and bluster about bonded ADSL at the moment. Organisations making some frankly outrageous claims about the throughput customers will see if they install a bonded ADSL solution. We are not saying these figures are wrong, but we all know that with ADSL the theoretical maximum sync speed is not necessarily what you get.

“At Evolving Networks we are different. Not only do we set realistic, even conservative, estimates of the throughput that customers will see when they switch to our bonded ADSL solutions, we provide our Enterprise Management Portal to make the delivered solution completely transparent.

“This means that our customers have 100% situational awareness as to the status and performance of their bonded ADSL link, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, wherever they are.

“Opening up the portal to prospective bonded ADSL customers as well is all about making the purchasing decision easier. A lot of our customers are in rural or semi rural locations and get flaky ADSL speeds. A lot even have two or three lines in place, each delivering wildly differing throughput speeds.

“Bonded ADSL from Evolving Networks is flexible and advanced enough to cope with variations in sync speeds and throughput rates from different ADSL lines, even sensing and adjusting bonding ratios on the fly. So we are confident in extracting the maximum throughput for every bonded ADSL customer.

“This latest innovation demonstrates our technical prowess to prospect clients as well as giving us more knowledge of a customers’ unique location prior to the installation process.

“We report back to you on the status of each ADSL line and how it is used. This information is then used to make a set of recommendations as to which bonded ADSL or bonded SDSL (or mix of both bonded ADSL and SDSL) is right for you.

“We find it helps people make the leap of faith required to move from a single link to a bonded ADSL solution”

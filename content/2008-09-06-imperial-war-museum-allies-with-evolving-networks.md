Evolving Networks today announce a major supply agreement with the Imperial War Museum. The agreement will see Evolving Networks supply bonded broadband connectivity to the War Museum’s Nitrate Film Store outside Saffron Walden.

The Film Store houses the Museum’s historic archive of Nitrate film reels that form part of an important national collection. The facility is in a remote location, which made the sourcing of a connectivity solution problematic. The installation of a leased line connection proved to be cost prohibitive due to the distance from the exchange and the time and financial implications of digging up the access road to deliver a service.

With a number of sites in the UK connected to the JANET network via high speed Ethernet connectivity, it was important that the link at Saffron Walden not only delivered a connection that was stable and reliable, but also that was capable of integrating with the existing VPN. Evolving Networks’ expertise in delivering a bonded broadband link with public IP addresses was an important factor in the selection of the solution.

Bonded broadband was the option chosen as the most cost effective alternative to a leased line, with the added advantage of fast delivery timescales. By truly bonding four ADSL circuits a high speed data link with built in failover will be created.

The nature of the Evolving Networks bonded broadband solution, which delivers a single data stream via a high speed private UK wide network, presenting Ethernet to the LAN facilitates easy integration with the existing VPN.

The ability of the bonded broadband link to handle time critical data was another important consideration, with CCTV traffic being passed from the site back to a central location via VPN.

Evolving Networks are the leading provider of next generation bonded broadband solutions, with offices in Southampton and Leicester. A national high capacity data network allied to a class leading data centre housing a central bonding cluster and hosted VMware environment enables businesses to take advantage of high speed connectivity solutions for a fraction of the cost of expensive leased line alternatives.

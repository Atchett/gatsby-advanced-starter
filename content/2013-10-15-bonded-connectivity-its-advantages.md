A common question we still get asked is, what is a [bonded internet connection][1]?

There are so many answers to this one question. To put it simply, a bonded connection is a business grade, fast, affordable, resilient broadband connection. An Evolving Networks bonded connection is exactly this, except we go that extra mile to tailor make the connection to the exact requirements of the end user.

Take two or more ADSL, FTTC, EFM or Leased Lines and combine their services to make a super-fast internet connection with added resiliency and the flexibility to grow as newer technologies become available or as and when your business expands.

How does bonding work?

Evolving Networks bond a little differently to other bonded internet suppliers. We bond using a specialised bespoke bonding device set up with our advanced bonding algorithms. This means we are able to bond multiple internet connections into a single high performance line, all determined by the available technology at a customers location.

Our bonding technology intelligently splits up your data at packet level before distributing it across all of the available paths out to the internet. It’s then cleverly pieced back together at its destination.

Imagine 2 or 3 FTTC connections bonded together giving your business a whopping 100Mbps+ Download and 20/30Mbps Upload (of course, dependent on local BT infrastructure).

**Resiliency**

Bonding multiple lines gives the end user added resiliency along with added peace of mind that if one of the bonded lines stops working, the remaining services continue to operate normally. Our bonding device intelligently re-adjusts its bonding profile to continue working without suffering downtime.

Choosing to bond multiple services such as [FTTC][2] & [ADSL][3] gives even more resiliency. Should one type of service suffer from downtime, the others will remain fully connected. Businesses using a single line internet connection could experience lengthy downtime, ultimately stalling work and costing fortunes.

**Future Proof**

Bonded connections with us are [future proofed][4]. That means that if you’re waiting for fibre and haven’t a clue when you will get it, we’ll bond the technology you do have available to provide you with what your business needs. Then when you do get fibre, we’ll seamlessly upgrade your connection to take advantage of it.

**QoS**

Something you may have noticed if you’ve been following our blog posts recently, is that we are able to offer true [QoS][5] on any of our bonded connections. Our [new hardware][6] has the ability to prioritise traffic the right way to make the most out of your connection. So, no matter what bonded connectivity you have with us – we can add [QoS][7] over it simply and effectively.

Why choose bonded connectivity?

For some people, bonded internet connections are either unknown or considered a thing of the past. Well we want people to know that they can count on bonded connectivity. Evolving Networks has the ability to bond any available technology to make newer, fast technologies both resilient and with added failover. Businesses are risking a lot if they are solely relying on a single line.

The Blackheath Nursery and Preparatory School is a co-educational school for children aged between 3 and 11 years old. As a school that prides itself on delivering the highest quality education to each pupil, a top quality internet connection is paramount.

Like many other Evolving Networks customers, Blackheath had previously been balancing their traffic across two separate ADSL lines. As the UK’s leading bonded ADSL experts, Evolving Networks’ bonded ADSL solution allows them to realise higher levels of throughput as well as a more stable connection at the same time.

A crucial factor for Blackheath was that not only were Evolving Networks offering the school truly bonded connectivity speeds and resilience, but – with FTTC on the horizon – Evolving Networks will also upgrade a line to FTTC ADSL with no charges or configuration changes needed. These agreements provide Blackheath Preparatory School with a completely future proof solution that delivers the internet connectivity that their staff and learning environment deserve.

eView Live, Evolving Networks’ very own online network monitoring system will allow the school to ensure that their bonded ADSL link is scaled appropriately as both the needs of the school and the available technologies change over the coming years.

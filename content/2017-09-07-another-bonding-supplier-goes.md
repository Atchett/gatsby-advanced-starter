## Bye Bye Easynet

Easynet have had a bonded offering for many years.

It was always pretty restrictive. Based only on a basic implementation of MLPPP and only able to bond 2 or 4 lines (no odd, or greater numbers), it had slow failover reaction time, and was delivered over a highly contended network.

The Easynet Etherstream and Surestream bonded products also mandated fresh PSTN lines, so there was no easy migration or upgrade process for customers.

## MDNX, Viatel, Solution1, Griffin

Easynet have been through many changes over the last few years. Bought by MDNX, which brought with it Viatel, Griffin and the Solution1 networks, this entity struggled to deliver a coherent offering.

But the bonded services stayed in the portfolio, until now.

The industry consolidating once again, Interoute bought Easynet.

As a result of that integration, they are withdrawing their Etherstream V and Etherstream A products – [bonded FTTC][1] and [bonded ADSL][2] to you and me.

Network upgrades always have casualties, and in this case it’s the loss of the Redback routers that accomplished the MLPPP bonding in their network.

They are also losing access to the Sky LLU broadband platform, which was only a carry over from the previous ownership of Easynet by Sky over a decade ago. Sky only bought Easynet in order to take its LLU platform and run with it.

## MLPPP not Good Enough for SD-WAN

MLPPP is a very old fashioned way of bonding. In software overlay terms it is primitive and inflexible, albeit is based on an agreed standard.

Designed more for the ISDN era, it’s time has long been up, and its not surprising that Easynet is abandoning it.  MLPPP is not the kind of technology you can build new and innovative products like SD-WAN on, which is what businesses are asking for now.

Interoute are now pushing their Ethernet circuits to existing customers with Etherstream. For many people this just isn’t viable based on their location, or the depth of their pockets.

It also downgrades their resilience (we all know what happens to leased lines when popular [UK datacentres go offline][3]).

So to any customers of Easynet that want to continue benefiting from a resilient bonded internet connection, and also want to add advanced software-defined features such as VoIP prioritisation, zero-touch QoS and bandwidth amplification, Evolving Networks stand ready to help you out.

## Evolving Networks Isn&#8217;t Going Anywhere

We never saw [bonding as a stop gap technology][4] and still don’t.

The industry has seen Upstream Internet close down, O2/BE Broadband withdraw its bonded product when purchased by Sky, Xrio go under, and now Easynet withdraw its bonded internet services.

There have been others of course too, those who try adding bonding to their portfolio, but never quite make it work.

Well we’re not going anywhere, and will continue to supply resilient, intelligent, flexible internet connections, based on bonding.

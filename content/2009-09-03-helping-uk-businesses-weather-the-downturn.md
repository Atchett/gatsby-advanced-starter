Downturn, recession, whatever you want to call it, one thing’s for sure – “it’s tough out there!”

As UK PLC as a whole takes stock of the recent market turbulence and prepares itself for more challenging market conditions, Evolving Networks are adopting a more flexible approach to the financing of their managed data and connectivity solutions.

By listening to customer’s needs they have been able to structure several recent deals to assist with customer’s cash flow and budgetary planning needs.

The company’s bonded broadband and Evolving Leased Line solutions have proved popular across the board, but have struck a particular chord with the SMB market who are keen to exploit the opportunities offered by high bandwidth internet access solutions.

For example, a recent managed network deal was structured with no set up or migration costs for the end user. A business with 28 offices was at the end of an MPLS contract and keen to reduce monthly management charges, but did not want to incur the substantial migration fees quoted by several large carriers.

By migrating the MPLS links on to their private UK backbone and upgrading to faster ADSL MAX or bonded broadband links at each site, Evolving Networks were able to increase connectivity to each site and deliver far more wholesale internet access – and allow for VoIP to remain in place – on a three year managed service contract with no migration costs incurred by the end user.

By recognising that SMB’s still need to have top quality communications in place, Evolving Networks hope to do their bit to assist everyone in benefitting from top quality IT solutions.

Gerry White, Business Development Manager, Evolving Networks, “we’re not just saying that we can cut costs on internet connectivity, our managed service offering goes further than that. We’re saying that we can deliver faster, secure internet access and deliver hosted computer power, disaster recovery & business continuity solutions, over the same connectivity, fully managed, with no set up charges and all cheaper than a leased line”.

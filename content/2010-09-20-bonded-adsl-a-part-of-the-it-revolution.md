**Over the years there have been several advancements in the IT world and bonded ADSL is one the latest trends for UK  businesses.** 

There have been many changes with information technology over the years and the most recent developments are creating positive changes for businesses all over the world. With genuine financial benefits, bonded ADSL has become one of the major innovations in modern connectivity and companies should consider the various benefits of ADSL bonding.

**What is Bonded ADSL?** 

Bonded ADSL is a solution that can increase the speed at which your business accesses the internet, making business processes faster, more streamline and more efficient.  By combining several internet connections, ADSL bonding creates one virtual connection which runs at a higher speed. Not only that, but this is at a fraction of the cost of a leased line, proving to be an extremely attractive investment for organisations across all sectors.

Bonded ADSL is able to achieve higher bandwidth, meaning that internet connections are speedier, and many companies find that their daily processes are much more streamlined and able to generate business efficiencies.

The phenomenon of ADSL bonding is just one small part of the IT revolution that is happening at present. Almost incited by the 2008 recession and the country’s shrinking budgets, bonded ADSL arrived just in time to reduce outgoing costs and optimise business operations. Combining several lines to deliver one faster, more resilient internet connection, bonded ADSL can reduce costs when compared with traditional leased lines.

**Times Are Changing**

The 2008 recession left the world’s finances in turmoil, and demand for cost effective business solutions, particularly in IT, grew dramatically. Bonded ADSL is among some of the many innovations that have taken the professional world by storm in recent years. Cloud computing, or ‘virtual server hosting’ has been one of the main buzz topics in the computing industry, and has proved to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for business IT.

With 2010 being the International Year of Biodiversity, there are many reasons to think about Corporate Social Responsibility and the way to use the earth’s resources. As biodiversity is affected by our carbon footprint, pollution and waste, reducing our energy consumption is more important than ever. Computing solutions such as cloud hosting and bonded ADSL can reduce outgoings for organisations of all sizes, and across all sectors.

Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, are sets of rules and guarantees that, in terms of the communication marketplace, are in place to ensure an agreed service standard for something you are buying.

Only, that’s not what they are at all really!  Most SLAs either don’t cover what you need them to cover, or don’t have enough of a penalty if they are broken.

Let’s be clear here, a 7 hour fix time as quoted by some EFM providers, does not mean that any and all EFM faults will be fixed within 7 hours of detection.

What it means is that they guarantee to fix it within 7 hours.

Hang on, that’s just what I need! I need a guarantee that it will definitely be fixed by hour 8.

But that isn’t what a guarantee is.  We use the word guarantee far too freely, and really want and expect it to mean that something will “definitely” happen.

In this case, and with almost all SLAs, the 7 hour fix time guarantee means simply that if they fail to fix it within 7 hours, then the provider is penalised in some way.

Ok, I hear you say, there is something in it for me in that I will probably get a refund of some kind, and yes, you might. But it will probably have a cap, and it will probably only be based on the amount of time the connection is actually down for, outside the 7 hour fix time.

Not many circuits have guarantees on latency, loss, jitter and throughput &#8211; just on uptime.

It can be quite difficult to prove these kinds of issues, especially when a customer is attempting to prove it on their own LAN behind a firewall, as you need to be able to prove a specific circuit is to blame.

We’ve put a huge amount of time and resource into our monitoring systems so that we can nip problems in the bud as soon as possible.

We also have an SLA and have always kept it as simple as we possibly can.  Regardless of what mix of circuits you have in your bonded internet connection, we wrap everything up in a 99.9% uptime SLA.

We handle the carriers for the individual circuits, so if it’s an EFM with TalkTalk Business, it will have a different set of rules to an ADSL from Vodafone, or an Ethernet from BT.  We don’t quote individual SLAs, just a simple uptime money-back guarantee.

What’s actually more important is what our commitment is to providing resilient, high quality internet connections.  We can’t structure an SLA better than the choice businesses make over who provides their internet connection.  If we don’t do what we say we will, or provide a sub-standard service in the eyes of the customer, then they will leave.

We do everything we can to keep every customer, and our retention rates are extremely high for the comms industry because we value each and every business that connects with us.

Actually we are going to review our SLA, which is why I think they are worth talking about now.  What it won’t be is complicated, because we don’t want it to consume a lot of time and effort and be confusing when people look at it.  We don’t want the SLA to be a 5 minute conversation over the phone!

What it will be is better than it is now, and probably impose bigger credits for customers who experience downtime.  Talking of downtime, I might cover that in a future post as maintaining internet connectivity is one of those areas that is very important to us for obvious reasons!

The message I need to get across though, to any current or future customer, is that Evolving Networks is committed to providing high calibre internet connections with industry leading performance and uptime.  Work and plans are constantly being made and executed so that we can continually improve how we deliver our services, and how we avoid problems.

We truly want to deliver great connectivity.  For us it’s both a matter of pride, and a point of principle that it really can be done.

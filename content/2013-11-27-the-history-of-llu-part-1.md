How significant is it that O2 have withdrawn from the LLU space?  We don’t yet know what Sky are planning to do, but they have a number of options, and they will probably go for the option that gives them the best cash return.

That’s not exactly surprising for a company trying to turn a profit, but that introduces the idea of Local Loop Unbundling, and what it really meant to the market, and to large swathes of the country.

BT were instructed as the monopoly provider of telecoms infrastructure to allow other communications providers access to their telephone exchanges, so that “true” competition could be introduced, and newer faster technologies could be delivered by other companies that could be more nimble than BT.

Companies like Bulldog and AOL started renting rack space in BT exchanges and providing different levels of unbundled service.  Here’s the important thing though – they went into the exchanges that made the most economical sense.  The place to make the most money is the place with the most subscribers.

So the first ADSL2+ services in the UK were provided by companies like Bulldog (years ahead of BT’s 21CN) but only in locations (like big inner cities) that had loads of potential punters.

This left rural areas and actually the majority of the UK not served and therefore not benefiting from this new competition or improved connection speeds.

Here’s the thing… nothing much has changed since.

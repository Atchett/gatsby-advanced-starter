**O2 UK has announced plans to no longer offer wholesale broadband services as of early next year. The operator states that continuing the service no longer falls in line with their company strategy. </p> 

Evolving Networks have the ability to offer O2 wholesale customers an easy migration to a bonded connectivity service that is future proofed. </strong>

Earlier this year the mobile operator sold its consumer phone and broadband businesses to Sky and O2 have now announced they will withdraw O2 wholesale from the channel as well.

O2 plan to take all services off the network before the end of February which will mean their existing and new customers will need to find an alternative option.

Running through Evolving Networks own private network, O2 wholesale customers can benefit from bonded connectivity solutions that are uncontended and resilient.

With cross carrier resilience and seamless migration of lines, Evolving Networks can ensure the fast transition of services to maintain O2 wholesale customers with their operational needs.

All Evolving Networks bonded solutions come with a future proof promise, meaning that when new technologies such as FTTC become widespread, customers lines can be upgraded free of charge.

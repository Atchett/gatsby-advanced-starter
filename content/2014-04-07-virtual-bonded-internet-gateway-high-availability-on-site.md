We now have our first customer with a virtual bonder!

At Evolving Networks we are always trying to push the technology to new limits, and make technological advancements useful to customers.

Manufacturing our own Bonded Internet Gateways has been an important step in that process, allowing us to overspec our hardware and start adding new and exciting features like <a href="/qos-benefits-more-than-just-voip-and-terminal-services" target="_blank">QoS</a> and <a href="/bandwidth-amplification/introducing-bandwidth-amplification" target="_blank">Bandwidth Amplification</a>.

We were the first ISP supplying bonded connections in the UK to use a completely virtualised central infrastructure, and then the first bonded ISP to spread that infrastructure across two geographically distinct datacentres to protect customer data flow as much as possible.

But while we have been virtualising our central bonding infrastructure, we have shied away so far from virtualising the customer premises equipment.  Until now!

We now have our first customer, who has as part of an upgrade from 4x bonded to 8x bonded ADSL2+, has moved to a virtual Bonded Internet Gateway.

The customer already has a VMware infrastructure, and so because they have invested in infrastructure and failover solutions, it seemed logical to push our offering further and use their VMware platform just like we use our own VSphere central infrastructure.

And what can I say? It’s working really well.  The customer has a very resilient platform and is protected against all sorts of local failures, be they power or hardware related, as well as benefitting from an efficient use of processing power and server rack footprint.

It’s not going to be something we will shout about a lot, as most businesses don’t have their own VMware, Hyper-V or XenServer platform, but the message is, we can do it!

We’re now planning our second customer, who also have a VM infrastructure on site, and getting them ready for the same upgrade.  They’ll benefit not only from the latest bonding algorithms, but the options of QoS for prioritisation of critical data, and Bandwidth Amplification if they want to boost their bandwidth and enhance their packet flow.

If you want to take advantage of high availability and utilise a platform you have already invested in, then contact your account manager, or our sales team and ask them about virtualising a bonder.

If you don’t have a virtual platform, you can still take advantage of the latest developments in bonded internet – get in touch with a member of the team and they will gladly help you with the requirements of your business.

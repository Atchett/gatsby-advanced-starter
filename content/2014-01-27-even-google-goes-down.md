Friday evening saw a pretty massive outage of Google services.  These days even people who aren’t massive fans of the search company still use one or more of their services on a daily if not hourly basis, so it had a massive impact.

I do feel for those users (probably with Android phones) who have chosen their allegiance and have literally everything with Google – docs, email, social media, website, the lot.

It’s reminiscent of the Fasthosts outage a couple of weeks ago, in that if you had your website, email, DNS and domain name all there, you were pretty much screwed.

Fasthosts are nothing compared to Google, but Google aren’t alone either.  There have been high profile outages of all the major players, at least those with large databases and datacenters (think Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft in the last 2-3 years).

Is it really possible to engineer a system that doesn’t go down?

I get asked this a lot, as our customers are seeking resilience of their internet connection – the life blood of most businesses now.

We spend a lot of time and money ensuring our network and the offering to customers is as resilient as it can be.  Obviously there are limits which are agreed.  We could spend even more to reduce outages even further.  We could over engineer each customer’s connection even more to lower their downtime, but in general a customer won’t pay for that – it’s just too expensive.

It is a difficult argument.  We can’t eliminate downtime completely, or rather if we could, our service would be too expensive for the average business to afford.

Most companies that choose to pay more to over engineer their connection have almost always already got a very comprehensive business continuity plan in place where the decisions of what risks to take have already been planned.

It’s all very well having an internet connection that doesn’t go down, but if, for example, you can’t get into your office building, or there is a gas leak, then it won’t do your business much good.

We’ve engineered a great internet connectivity solution that has various degrees of resilience depending on what you want, and what is available to you.  A bonded connection of more than one circuit type is most resilient than just a Bonded ADSL connection, for example, but we can’t insist every customer buys one!

We have virtualisation options for the hardware on site, so if you have your own Virtual Server infrastructure, you can host a virtual Bonded Internet appliance.

Can we eliminate outages? The answer is either yes, but it costs a lot of money, or no, you can’t afford it.

I am encouraged even as I write this, to see in the background of our technical support team, a summary of those connections that are currently affected by storms, but that still have at least one line up.  There are 3 schools right now on our list that are only up because they chose a bonded internet connection.  Over the weekend they suffered storms, but they can still work because they are online.

Google, Microsoft, Amazon – you can bet they spend a lot of money on resiliency because they don’t want the bad press of an outage, but in reality, there will always be something (and maybe even human error) that can cause an outage.

Choosing a bonded internet connection is one of the simplest and cheapest ways of mitigating your risk, especially when you rely on services from these companies.  We’re not perfect either, but we are solely focused on delivering world class internet connectivity, with a passion for improving the customer experience.

No one likes outages, but when Google goes down, it actually reminds me that we’re doing well, even in comparison.

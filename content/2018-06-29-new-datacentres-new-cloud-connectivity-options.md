We are pleased to announce a new core network partnership that will see our network expand into two additional major UK datacentres.

After a year-long project to find an additional partner to augment our core routing infrastructure, we have signed an agreement with Luminet that will see us add EVXcores into two London Equinix DCs.

By expanding in this way, we gain greater flexibility to deploy SD-WANs across the country and gain access to the Luminet product portfolio of wireless services that can be integrated fully into all our connections.

Our strategy has always been to integrate as many forms of connectivity as possible into our Multipath Ethernet service.

With Luminet’s ability to quickly (even same day) deliver high bandwidth solutions to SMEs, as well as using a technology complimentary to fixed lines, our customers will gain from connectivity combinations that will get them up and running fast, and with amazing reliability.

Access to the Equinix datacentres also gives us the scope to easily add ExpressRoute connections to Microsoft Azure.

Gaining in popularity, Azure gives businesses the ability to create a complete cloud-based virtual infrastructure, replacing even the most complex hosting and networking environments.

If your business is moving services to the cloud, whether it’s with Azure, Amazon or Google, or with your own private hosting, talk to us now about using SD-WAN to connect to the cloud.
